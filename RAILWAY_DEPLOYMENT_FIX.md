# Railway Deployment Fix for Composite Rankings 422 Error

## Problem
Railway is returning 403/422 errors for `/api/v1/prospects/composite-rankings` because it's running old code that requires authentication (`get_current_user`) instead of the updated code with optional authentication (`get_current_user_optional`).

## Root Cause
Railway has not deployed the latest commits yet, specifically:
- Commit `bd65c3b` added the composite-rankings endpoint with optional auth
- Commit `efdbb48` was pushed to force redeployment
- Railway is still serving old code or the deployment is in progress

## Evidence
1. Local code has `get_current_user_optional` (verified line 1403 in prospects.py)
2. Railway returns 403 "Not authenticated" for unauthenticated requests
3. Railway returns 401 "Invalid authentication token" for invalid auth
4. This behavior matches `get_current_user` (required auth), not `get_current_user_optional`

## Solution Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Check Railway Dashboard**
   - Go to Railway project dashboard
   - Check if deployment for commit `efdbb48` is in progress or failed
   - If deployment failed, check build logs for errors
   - If deployment is stuck, manually trigger a new deployment

2. **Verify Deployment Branch**
   - Confirm Railway is deploying from the `DM` branch (user confirmed this)
   - Check Railway settings → Deployment → Source to verify branch

3. **Manual Deployment Trigger** (if automatic deployment didn't work)
   - In Railway dashboard, click "Deploy" → "Redeploy"
   - Or use Railway CLI: `railway up --service api`

### Verification Steps
Once deployment completes, test the endpoint:

```bash
# Should return data WITHOUT authentication (free tier, top 100)
curl "https://api-production-f7e0.up.railway.app/api/v1/prospects/composite-rankings?page=1&page_size=10"
```

Expected response: JSON with prospect rankings, NOT "Not authenticated" error

### Backend is Ready
- ✅ FanGraphs tables populated (2,309 hitters, 2,423 pitchers)
- ✅ Endpoint code has optional authentication
- ✅ Local testing successful
- ✅ All code committed and pushed to origin/DM
- ❌ Railway deployment not complete

## Technical Details

### Correct Code (in repository)
```python
@router.get("/composite-rankings", response_model=CompositeRankingsPage)
async def get_composite_rankings(
    # ... parameters ...
    current_user: Optional[User] = Depends(get_current_user_optional),  # ✅ OPTIONAL
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
) -> CompositeRankingsPage:
```

### What Railway is Running (old code)
```python
# Railway appears to be running code with:
current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),  # ❌ REQUIRED (wrong!)
```

### How `get_current_user_optional` Works
- Returns `None` if no auth headers present (allows unauthenticated access)
- Returns `User` object if valid auth token provided
- Returns `None` if invalid auth token (doesn't raise error)
- Endpoint then defaults to "free" tier for None users

## Next Steps After Deployment

Once Railway deployment completes:
1. Frontend will automatically start working
2. Unauthenticated users get top 100 prospects (free tier)
3. Authenticated users get up to 500 prospects (premium tier)
4. No code changes needed - just waiting for Railway to deploy

## Commits Involved
- `bd65c3b` - Added composite rankings feature with optional auth
- `e4a8ef8` - Empty commit to trigger Railway redeploy
- `a7ed137` - Added database utility scripts
- `efdbb48` - Force Railway redeploy for optional auth fix
