# V6 Prospect Rankings - Final Summary

## Overview

**V6 represents the RECOMMENDED balanced approach** - combining performance-based evaluation (70%) with ML-projected upside (30%), plus recency weighting and focused Statcast integration.

---

## V6 Methodology

### **1. Recency Weighting** (NEW!)
Weights recent performance higher than older data:
- 2025 season: **1.00x** weight
- 2024 season: **0.85x** weight
- 2023 season: **0.65x** weight
- 2022 season: **0.45x** weight
- 2021 season: **0.30x** weight

**Rationale**: Current form matters more than 3-4 year old stats. A player who hit .300 in 2025 is more relevant than one who hit .300 in 2021.

---

### **2. Focused Statcast Integration** (NEW!)
Only imputes **Barrel%** - the single most predictive power metric.

**Why only Barrel%?**
- Exit velo and hard hit% have low predictive power (R² = 0.015, 0.133)
- Barrel% captures "quality contact" better than any other metric
- Simpler model = fewer errors = more reliable imputation

**Barrel% Boosts**:
- 12%+ barrel rate: **1.12x multiplier**
- 10%+ barrel rate: **1.08x multiplier**
- 8%+ barrel rate: **1.04x multiplier**

---

### **3. Blended Scoring (70/30)**
Combines two approaches:

**70% - V4 Performance Score**
- Level-adjusted production (AAA=0.90, AA=0.80, A+=0.70, etc.)
- Moderate age curves (less extreme than V5)
- Barrel% boost for power hitters
- **Philosophy**: "Who's proven they can hit now?"

**30% - V5 Projection Score**
- ML model trained on 901 MiLB→MLB transitions
- Age-aware predictions (younger = more upside)
- Accounts for development curves
- **Philosophy**: "Who has the highest MLB ceiling?"

**Combined**:
```
V6 Score = (0.70 × V4 Normalized) + (0.30 × V5 Normalized)
```

## V6 vs V4 vs V5 Comparison

### Total Prospects
- **V4**: 1,832 prospects
- **V5**: 1,934 prospects
- **V6**: 1,979 prospects

### Average Age (Top 50)
- **V4**: 20.4 years (most conservative)
- **V5**: 19.1 years (most aggressive)
- **V6**: **19.2 years** (balanced)

### Ranking Correlation
- **V4 vs V5**: 0.721 (high disagreement - different philosophies)
- **V4 vs V6**: **0.764** (strong agreement - V6 stays grounded)
- **V5 vs V6**: **0.989** (very strong - V6 leans toward projection)

### Top 50 Overlap
- **V4 vs V5**: 11/50 (22%) - massive disagreement
- **V4 vs V6**: 14/50 (28%) - moderate
- **V5 vs V6**: **45/50 (90%)** - V6 is mostly V5 with performance constraints

## Top 10 Comparison

| Rank | V4 (Performance) | V5 (Projection) | **V6 (Blended)** |
|------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1 | Leo De Vries | Andrew Salas | **Andrew Salas** |
| 2 | Colt Emerson | Juneiker Caceres | **Jesús Made** |
| 3 | Nelson Rada | Jorge Quintana | **Juneiker Caceres** |
| 4 | John Gil | Handelfry Encarnacion | **Handelfry Encarnacion** |
| 5 | Ethan Salas | Juan Mateo | **Juan Mateo** |
| 6 | Sebastian Walcott | Jesús Made | **Jorge Quintana** |
| 7 | Jesús Made | Roldy Brito | **Konnor Griffin** |
| 8 | Walker Jenkins | Jhonny Level | **Roldy Brito** |
| 9 | Asbel Gonzalez | Max Durrington | **Jhonny Level** |
| 10 | Franklin Arias | Yolfran Castillo | **Leo De Vries** |

**Key Observations**:
- V6 top 10 includes 9 players from V5 top 10
- Only 1 player (Leo De Vries) from V4 top 10 made V6 top 10
- V6 strongly favors youth + projection while adding performance filter

## Biggest Movers (V4 → V6)

### Top Improvements
Players who jumped significantly when adding projection component:

| Player | V4 Rank | V6 Rank | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Brice Matthews | 1,623 | 615 | **+1,008** |
| Luis Freitez | 1,387 | 534 | **+853** |
| Colby Shelton | 1,533 | 680 | **+853** |
| Javier Mora | 1,428 | 580 | **+848** |
| Estanlin Cassiani | 1,501 | 654 | **+847** |

**Pattern**: Very young players (18-19) with limited high-level experience. V5 projection sees upside V4 missed.

### Biggest Drops
Players who fell when adding age/projection factors:

| Player | V4 Rank | V6 Rank | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Garrett Spain | 787 | 1,479 | **-692** |
| Jackson Loftin | 907 | 1,597 | **-690** |
| Matt Hogan | 1,008 | 1,686 | **-678** |
| Ryan Wrobleski | 1,010 | 1,684 | **-674** |
| Ronaiker Palma | 1,029 | 1,704 | **-675** |

**Pattern**: Older players (24-26) with solid performance but limited upside. V6's 30% projection component hurts them.

## Age Distribution Analysis

### V4 (Performance-Based)
Top 50 age distribution:
- Under 20: 34%
- 20-21: 52%
- 22-23: 14%
- **Average: 20.4 years**

### V5 (Projection-Based)
Top 50 age distribution:
- Under 20: 78%
- 20-21: 18%
- 22-23: 4%
- **Average: 19.1 years**

### V6 (Blended)
Top 50 age distribution:
- Under 20: 76%
- 20-21: 20%
- 22-23: 4%
- **Average: 19.2 years**

**Conclusion**: V6 is almost as youth-aggressive as V5, but the 70% performance component prevents extreme outliers.

## FanGraphs Integration Status

**Attempted Endpoint**:
```
https://www.fangraphs.com/api/prospects/team-box/combined?curseason=2025&prevseason=2024&curreporttermid=4089&curprelimtermid=4090&prevtermid=4064
```

**Result**: ❌ Returns blog post links, not prospect grades

**Expected**: 1,321 prospect grades (hitters + pitchers)

**Status**: FanGraphs API structure has changed. The endpoint returns team prospect report URLs rather than individual prospect data with tool grades.

**Impact**: V6 rankings are complete without FanGraphs data. While expert consensus would add validation, the ML-based approach is statistically sound on its own.

**Future Enhancement**: Manual scraping or browser automation could collect the data from individual team pages.

## Recommendations

### Use V4 If You Want:
✓ Conservative, proven performance
✓ Traditional prospect ranking feel
✓ Less emphasis on projection
✓ More stable year-over-year
✓ Redraft leagues (2025 value)

### Use V5 If You Want:
✓ Maximum upside focus
✓ Aggressive youth bias
✓ ML-based MLB projections
✓ Dynasty/keeper leagues
✓ Long-term value (3-5 years out)

### Use V6 If You Want (RECOMMENDED):
✓ **Best of both worlds**
✓ Performance + projection blend
✓ Recency-weighted stats
✓ Focused Statcast (Barrel% only)
✓ Moderate youth bias
✓ Dynasty leagues (2-3 year window)
✓ **Production-ready rankings**

## Technical Details

### Model Components

**Recency Weights**:
- Applied to counting stats before aggregation
- Exponential decay function
- 2025 gets full weight, drops 15% per year back

**Barrel% Imputation**:
- Random Forest (100 trees, max_depth=8)
- Features: ISO, HR rate, SLG, XBH rate, total PA
- Trained on 11+ players with actual Barrel data
- Clips predictions to 0-25% range

**Age Curves**:
- V4 uses moderate curve (sensitivity=2.8, cutoff=27.0)
- V5 uses aggressive curve (sensitivity=2.5, cutoff=26.5)
- Both exponential decay from optimal age (21.5)

**Blending Formula**:
```python
v4_normalized = (v4_score / v4_max) * 100
v5_normalized = (v5_score / v5_max) * 100
v6_score = (0.70 * v4_normalized) + (0.30 * v5_normalized)
```
