# Pitching Data Collection Fix - Summary

## Problem
The MiLB game log collection script was only collecting hitting statistics, which meant:
- Zero pitching game logs were being collected
- All pitchers showed 0 games pitched in the database
- Pitchers appeared to have no professional experience
- Prospect filtering by IP threshold was impossible

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Data Collection Script
**File**: `scripts/collect_all_milb_gamelog.py`

**Key Changes**:

#### A. Enhanced `get_player_game_logs()` method
- Added `group` parameter to support both 'hitting' and 'pitching' data requests
- Now can fetch either type of stats from MLB Stats API

#### B. Created separate save methods
- `save_hitting_game_log()` - Saves hitting statistics to database
- `save_pitching_game_log()` - Saves pitching statistics to database
- Each method maps the correct fields from API response to database columns

#### C. Updated `process_player()` logic
```python
# Always collect hitting stats (even pitchers hit in MiLB)
hitting_logs = await self.get_player_game_logs(player_id, sport_id, group='hitting')

# For pitchers, also collect pitching stats
if is_pitcher:
    pitching_logs = await self.get_player_game_logs(player_id, sport_id, group='pitching')
```

#### D. Added pitcher position detection
```python
PITCHER_POSITIONS = {'P', 'SP', 'RP', 'LHP', 'RHP'}
is_pitcher = position in self.PITCHER_POSITIONS
```

#### E. Enhanced statistics tracking
- Tracks hitting and pitching games separately
- Shows both counts in progress updates and final summary
- Provides average games per player/pitcher

### 2. College Player Filtering
**File**: `scripts/collect_all_milb_gamelog.py`

**Enhancement to `get_milb_teams()` method**:
- Filters out college/amateur leagues by name
- Requires teams to have MLB parent organization
- Validates teams are in recognized MiLB leagues
- Prevents collection of college player data

```python
# Skip college leagues and non-affiliated teams
if 'college' in league_name or 'amateur' in league_name:
    continue

# Require MLB affiliation or recognized MiLB league
if team.get('parentOrgId') or recognized_milb_league:
    professional_teams.append(team)
```

### 3. Database Schema
**Already supported**: The `milb_game_logs` table already has all 63 pitching stat fields including:
- Basic: `games_pitched`, `innings_pitched`, `wins`, `losses`, `saves`
- Results: `hits_allowed`, `runs_allowed`, `earned_runs`, `strikeouts_pitched`, `walks_allowed`
- Rates: `era`, `whip`, `strikeouts_per_9inn`, `walks_per_9inn`
- Advanced: `babip`, `obp_against`, `slg_against`, `ops_against`

No schema changes required - the infrastructure was already in place!

## How to Run

### Collect Data
```bash
cd apps/api
python scripts/collect_all_milb_gamelog.py --season 2024 --levels AAA AA A+
```

### Optional: Include lower levels
```bash
python scripts/collect_all_milb_gamelog.py --season 2024 --levels AAA AA A+ A Rookie Rookie+
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
Total players processed: 5000
Players with game data: 2000
Total games collected: 150000
Average games/player: 75.0

Database:
- games_pitched > 0: 0 rows ❌
- Pitchers with data: 0 ❌
```

### After Fix
```
Total players processed: 5000
Players with hitting data: 2000
Players with pitching data: 1200
Total hitting games collected: 150000
Total pitching games collected: 80000
Average hitting games/player: 75.0
Average pitching games/pitcher: 66.7

Database:
- games_pitched > 0: ~80000 rows ✅
- Pitchers with data: ~1200 ✅
```

## Verification Queries

### Check pitching data exists
```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN games_pitched > 0 THEN 1 END) as pitching_rows,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN games_played > 0 THEN 1 END) as hitting_rows,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN games_pitched > 0 THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as pct_pitching
FROM milb_game_logs
WHERE season = 2024;
```

### Top pitchers by innings
```sql
SELECT
    mlb_player_id,
    level,
    SUM(games_pitched) as appearances,
    ROUND(SUM(innings_pitched), 1) as total_ip,
    ROUND(AVG(era), 2) as avg_era,
    SUM(strikeouts_pitched) as strikeouts
FROM milb_game_logs
WHERE games_pitched > 0 AND season = 2024
GROUP BY mlb_player_id, level
ORDER BY total_ip DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Verify prospect rankings now include pitchers
```sql
SELECT
    position,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN games > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as with_games,
    ROUND(AVG(games), 1) as avg_games
FROM prospect_rankings
WHERE season = 2024
GROUP BY position
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## Impact on ML Models

With pitching data now available:
- Pitcher prospect models can use real professional experience
- Filtering by IP threshold (e.g., 30 IP minimum) now works correctly
- Feature engineering can include pitching progression across levels
- Rankings will be more accurate for pitchers

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `scripts/collect_all_milb_gamelog.py` - Main collection script with pitching support
2. ✅ `DATA_COLLECTION_DIAGNOSIS.md` - Updated with solution status
3. ✅ `test_pitching_collection.py` - Test script for validation
4. ✅ `PITCHING_DATA_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This document

## Next Actions

1. Run the updated collection script for 2024 season
2. Verify pitching data is being saved correctly
3. Re-run prospect ranking generation to include pitcher game counts
4. Update ML training pipelines to use pitching features
5. Consider backfilling 2023 and earlier seasons if needed
