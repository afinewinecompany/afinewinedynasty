# Composite Rankings Pitch Count Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The composite rankings page was showing incorrect pitch counts for players who had played at multiple minor league levels. For example, Bryce Eldridge was showing only 292 pitches when he actually had 1,923 total pitches in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Database Investigation Results
- **Bryce Eldridge Actual Data:**
  - Total pitches in database: 1,923
  - Pitches in last 60 days: 452
  - Breakdown by level:
    - AAA: 292 pitches (last 60 days)
    - AA: 160 pitches (last 60 days)
    - Complex: 0 pitches (last 60 days)

### The Problem
The `PitchDataAggregator` service in `app/services/pitch_data_aggregator.py` was only querying pitch data for a SINGLE level (the most recent one) instead of aggregating across ALL levels a player had played at during the time period.

Specifically, in the `get_hitter_pitch_metrics` method:
```sql
WHERE mlb_batter_id = :mlb_player_id
    AND level = :level  -- This was limiting to just one level
    AND game_date >= CURRENT_DATE - CAST(:days || ' days' AS INTERVAL)
```

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made
1. **Modified `get_hitter_pitch_metrics` method** to:
   - First query all levels the player has played at in the time period
   - Aggregate metrics across ALL levels, not just one
   - Include tracking of which levels are included in the aggregation
   - Show the total pitch count across all levels

2. **Modified `get_pitcher_pitch_metrics` method** similarly for pitchers

### Key Code Changes
```python
# OLD: Single level query
AND level = :level

# NEW: Multi-level aggregation
AND level = ANY(:levels)  -- Include ALL levels the player played at
```

### New Features Added
- The response now includes `levels_included` array showing which levels contributed to the data
- An `aggregation_note` field indicates when data is aggregated from multiple levels
- Proper logging shows the total pitch count across all levels

## Expected Results After Fix

### Before Fix
- Bryce Eldridge: 292 pitches (AAA only)
- Other multi-level players: Showing partial data

### After Fix
- Bryce Eldridge: 452 pitches (AAA + AA combined for last 60 days)
- Other multi-level players: Showing complete aggregated data

## Files Modified
1. `app/services/pitch_data_aggregator.py` - Core fix to aggregation logic
2. Created backup: `app/services/pitch_data_aggregator.py.bak`

## Testing Performed
- Verified Bryce Eldridge's pitch counts in database
- Checked aggregation logic for multiple levels
- Tested with various time periods (60 days, 30 days)
- Confirmed percentile calculations still work with aggregated data

## Next Steps for Full Deployment

1. **Clear Redis Cache** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   python clear_rankings_cache.py
   ```

2. **Restart the API Server** to ensure the changes take effect

3. **Verify in Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the composite rankings page
   - Check Bryce Eldridge's pitch count (should show 452 instead of 292)
   - Verify other players with multi-level experience show correct totals

4. **Monitor Logs** for the new aggregation messages:
   ```
   Player 805811: 452 pitches across levels ['AAA', 'AA'] in 60d
   Aggregated 452 pitches from levels: ['AA', 'AAA']
   ```

## Impact
This fix ensures that:
- Players who move between levels during the season get proper credit for ALL their performance data
- The composite rankings more accurately reflect a player's total body of work
- Performance metrics are calculated on the complete dataset, not just a subset

## Additional Notes
- The percentile comparisons still use the player's primary/highest level for fair comparison
- The fix is backward compatible and won't affect players who only played at one level
- The same logic was applied to both hitter and pitcher metrics for consistency
