# Rankings Update with MiLB Pitch Data - COMPLETE

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR USE

---

## Summary

The composite ranking system has been successfully updated to integrate the comprehensive MiLB pitch-by-pitch data we collected. The rankings now automatically use pitch-level metrics when available, providing more accurate performance assessments.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Data Collection ✅
**Collected 1.66 Million Pitches:**
- **Batter Pitches:** 1,130,218 from 1,023 batters
- **Pitcher Pitches:** 532,541 from 400 pitchers
- **Game Logs:** 238,301 games from 6,159 players
- **Coverage:** 59.5% of all prospects (1,391 out of 2,336)

**Key Prospects Verified:**
- Bryce Eldridge: 1,923 pitches (110% complete) ✓
- Konnor Griffin: 2,080 pitches (100% complete) ✓
- Bubba Chandler: 2,298 pitches thrown ✓

### 2. Ranking System Integration ✅
**Automatic Pitch Data Integration:**

The ranking system ([prospect_ranking_service.py](app/services/prospect_ranking_service.py)) now:

1. **Prioritizes pitch-level data** (lines 103-155)
   - Queries `milb_batter_pitches` and `milb_pitcher_pitches` tables
   - Calculates comprehensive pitch metrics (chase rate, zone%, whiff%, etc.)
   - Converts to percentiles vs level peers
   - Uses weighted composite scoring

2. **Falls back to game logs** if pitch data unavailable (lines 162-203)
   - Uses OPS for batters, ERA for pitchers
   - Estimates percentiles based on level benchmarks

3. **Dynamically calculates** on each API request
   - No static rankings file
   - Always uses latest data
   - Cache cleared (will regenerate on next request)

### 3. How It Works

**For Prospects WITH Pitch Data:**
```
Base FV (FanGraphs) + Performance Modifier (from pitch metrics)
```

**Performance Modifier Calculation:**
1. Query last 60 days of pitch data
2. Calculate metrics (chase rate, whiff%, zone%, etc.)
3. Convert each metric to percentile vs level
4. Calculate weighted composite percentile
5. Convert to modifier (-10 to +10 scale)

**Example:**
- Bryce Eldridge: Base FV 55
- Pitch metrics show 75th percentile composite
- Performance modifier: +5
- **Adjusted Score: 60**

**For Prospects WITHOUT Pitch Data:**
- Falls back to game log OPS/ERA percentiles
- Same modifier scale (-10 to +10)

## Data Quality

### Coverage by Type
| Data Type | Count | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|

## What Happens Next

### Automatic Updates
The rankings will **automatically** reflect the new pitch data:

1. **User visits rankings page** on frontend
2. **API receives request** for composite rankings
3. **System checks cache** (currently cleared)
4. **Generates fresh rankings** using:
   - FanGraphs base scores
   - **NEW: Pitch-level metrics** (1.66M pitches)
   - Game log data (fallback)
   - Trend analysis
   - Age adjustments
5. **Returns updated rankings** with pitch-based performance modifiers
6. **Caches result** for fast subsequent requests

### No Manual Intervention Required
- Rankings calculate dynamically
- Pitch data automatically integrated
- Cache will regenerate on first request
- Future updates just need data refreshes
