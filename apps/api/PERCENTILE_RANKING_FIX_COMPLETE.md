# Fixed: Pitch Data Percentiles Now Working Correctly ✅

**Date:** October 30, 2025
**Status:** FIXED - Rankings now use proper peer comparisons

---

## Problem Identified

The pitch data WAS being used, but all players were getting the same percentile (47.4%) because:
1. The system tried to query materialized views (`mv_hitter_percentiles_by_level`) that didn't exist
2. When views weren't found, it defaulted to 50th percentile for all metrics
3. This made every player appear "average" regardless of actual performance

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Materialized Views
Created `mv_hitter_percentiles_by_level` and `mv_pitcher_percentiles_by_level` that calculate:
- Percentile distributions for each metric at each level
- Based on actual 2025 MiLB pitch data
- Comparing players to their true peer groups

### 2. Real Percentile Comparisons
Now the system properly compares each player to peers at their level:

**Example Results:**
- **Bryce Eldridge (AAA)**
  - Contact Rate: 69.2% (below AAA median of 77.3%)
  - Whiff Rate: 30.8% (worse than AAA median of 21.6%)
  - **Result:** 33.9th percentile → -2.0 modifier

- **Konnor Griffin (AA)**
  - Contact Rate: 75.7% (near AA median of 77.1%)
  - Whiff Rate: 24.3% (near AA median of 22.4%)
  - **Result:** 48.5th percentile → +0.0 modifier

---

## How Rankings Work Now

### 1. Data Collection
- 1.66M pitches from 2025 MiLB games
- Metrics: contact%, whiff%, chase%, zone contact%

### 2. Peer Comparison (NEW!)
- Each level has its own percentile distributions
- Players compared to others at same level
- True percentile ranking (not default 50%)

### 3. Performance Modifiers
Based on composite percentile:
- 95th+ percentile: **+10**
- 90th percentile: **+8**
- 75th percentile: **+5**
- 60th percentile: **+2**
- 40-60th: **0** (average)
- 25th percentile: **-2**
- 10th percentile: **-5**
- <10th percentile: **-10**

### 4. Final Score
```
Base FV + Performance Modifier = Composite Score
```

## Verified Examples

### Bryce Eldridge
- **Metrics:** 69.2% contact, 30.8% whiff
- **Percentile vs AAA:** 33.9th (below average)
- **Modifier:** -2.0
- **Base FV:** 55
- **Final Score:** 53.0

### Konnor Griffin
- **Metrics:** 75.7% contact, 24.3% whiff
- **Percentile vs AA:** 48.5th (average)
- **Modifier:** 0.0
- **Base FV:** 65
- **Final Score:** 65.0

## Database Changes

### New Materialized Views
```sql
-- Hitter percentiles by level
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_hitter_percentiles_by_level AS ...

-- Pitcher percentiles by level
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_pitcher_percentiles_by_level AS ...
```

### Sample Data (AAA Level)
- **508 hitters** analyzed
- Median contact rate: 77.3%
- Median whiff rate: 21.6%
- Median chase rate: Data quality issues (many NULLs)

## Files Created/Modified

### Scripts
- [create_percentile_views.sql](scripts/create_percentile_views.sql) - SQL to create materialized views
- [execute_create_percentile_views.py](scripts/execute_create_percentile_views.py) - Python script to execute SQL
- [test_percentile_calculation.py](test_percentile_calculation.py) - Testing proper percentiles

### Documentation
- [PERCENTILE_RANKING_FIX_COMPLETE.md](PERCENTILE_RANKING_FIX_COMPLETE.md) - This file
- [PITCH_DATA_USAGE_CONFIRMED.md](PITCH_DATA_USAGE_CONFIRMED.md) - Initial investigation

---

## Impact

### Before Fix
- All players: ~47% percentile (everyone average)
- No differentiation based on performance
- Rankings mainly based on FanGraphs FV

### After Fix
- Real percentiles based on peer comparison
- Performance modifiers reflect actual skill
- Rankings now combine scouting (FV) + performance (pitch data)

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Refresh Views Periodically
```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_hitter_percentiles_by_level;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_pitcher_percentiles_by_level;
```

### 2. Fix Data Quality Issues
- Many zone values are NULL/0 (chase rate calculation)
- Launch speed all NULL (no exit velocity)
- Consider filtering or imputing missing values

### 3. Add More Levels
Currently have data for:
- AAA, AA, A+, A, Complex

Could add:
- Rookie, DSL, FCL, etc.

## Conclusion

**✅ FIXED:** Rankings now properly use pitch data with accurate peer comparisons

The composite rankings finally reflect both:
1. **Scouting grades** (FanGraphs FV)
2. **Actual performance** (pitch-level metrics vs peers)

Players who perform better than their level peers get positive modifiers, while those who underperform get negative modifiers. This creates more accurate and dynamic rankings!
