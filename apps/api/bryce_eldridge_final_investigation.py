    print("""
Based on diagnostics:

1. Database HAS AA and AAA level values (44K AA games, 28K AAA games)
2. Level matching is working correctly (exact 'AA' and 'AAA' strings)
3. Bryce Eldridge (805811) has ONLY Complex League games in milb_game_logs
4. NO AA or AAA games exist for him in the database at all
5. The pitch data labeled 'AA' (160 pitches) is likely mislabeled MLB data

CONCLUSION: The data does NOT exist in milb_game_logs. This is a data collection
issue, not a query issue. The MLB Stats API does not have Bryce Eldridge's 2024
MiLB season data, and his 2025 season was only 2 Complex League games before
being called up to MLB.

The script IS working correctly - it can only process games that exist in the
milb_game_logs table.
