# MLB Performance Prediction ML Strategy

## Executive Summary
With complete 2024-2025 MiLB data (1.1M+ games, 13,700+ players), we can build sophisticated models to predict MLB performance using wRC+ and wOBA as primary targets, with age-adjusted projections and player similarity matching.

## ðŸ“Š Available Data Assets

### 1. **MiLB Game Logs (Primary Feature Source)**
- **Coverage**: 2021-2025 (5 seasons)
- **Volume**: 1,095,803 games
- **Players**: 13,746 unique players
- **Stats**: 99 fields per game (36 hitting, 63 pitching)
- **Levels**: AAA, AA, A+, A, Rookie+, Winter

### 2. **MLB Game Logs (Target Labels)**
- **Coverage**: 2020-2025
- **Players**: 1,518 with MLB experience
- **Games**: 200,504 MLB games
- **Overlap**: ~11% of MiLB players have MLB data

## ðŸŽ¯ ML Target Variables

### Primary Targets (MLB Performance)

#### **1. wRC+ (Weighted Runs Created Plus)**
- **Definition**: Offensive value relative to league average (100 = average)
- **Advantages**:
  - Park and league adjusted
  - Single number captures overall offensive value
  - Easily interpretable (120 = 20% above average)
- **Prediction Range**: 0-200 (typical MLB range: 50-150)

#### **2. wOBA (Weighted On-Base Average)**
- **Definition**: Linear weights-based offensive metric
- **Scale**: Similar to OBP (.320 = average)
- **Advantages**:
  - More accurate than OPS
  - Directly translates to run scoring
- **Prediction Range**: .200-.450

#### **3. Peak wRC+ (Age-Adjusted)**
- **Concept**: Project peak performance, not just next season
- **Age Curve Peaks**:
  - Position Players: 26-28 years old
  - Power Hitters: 27-29 years old
  - Speed Players: 24-26 years old
- **Implementation**: Predict wRC+ at age 27, adjust for current age

### Secondary Targets
- **WAR/600 PA**: Wins Above Replacement per full season
- **MLB Success Probability**: Binary (reaches MLB or not)
- **MLB Debut Timeline**: Years until MLB debut
- **Career Length**: Projected MLB seasons

## ðŸ§¬ Feature Engineering Strategy

### Level 1: Raw Statistics Aggregation
```python
# Per-level aggregations (AAA, AA, A+, etc.)
features = {
    'games_played': sum,
    'plate_appearances': sum,
    'batting_avg': mean,
    'obp': mean,
    'slg': mean,
    'ops': mean,
    'walk_rate': bb / pa,
    'strikeout_rate': so / pa,
    'iso_power': slg - avg,
    'babip': mean
}
```

### Level 2: Age-Relative Performance
```python
# Compare to league average at same age
age_adjusted_features = {
    'ops_plus': player_ops / league_age_ops * 100,
    'avg_plus': player_avg / league_age_avg * 100,
    'k_rate_plus': league_k_rate / player_k_rate * 100,
    'relative_age': player_age - league_avg_age
}
```

### Level 3: Development Trajectories
```python
# Year-over-year improvements
trajectory_features = {
    'ops_growth_rate': (ops_y2 - ops_y1) / ops_y1,
    'level_jump_performance': aaa_ops / aa_ops,
    'consistency': std(monthly_ops),
    'peak_performance': max(monthly_ops)
}
```

### Level 4: Competition Quality Adjustments
```python
# Weight stats by level difficulty
level_weights = {
    'AAA': 1.0,
    'AA': 0.85,
    'A+': 0.70,
    'A': 0.60,
    'Rookie': 0.40
}

weighted_ops = sum(level_ops * level_weight) / sum(level_weight)
```

## ðŸ¤– Model Architecture

### Ensemble Approach

#### **1. Gradient Boosting (Primary)**
```python
from xgboost import XGBRegressor

xgb_model = XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=1000,
    max_depth=6,
    learning_rate=0.01,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
    objective='reg:squarederror'
)
```

#### **2. Deep Neural Network (Pattern Detection)**
```python
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential, layers

dnn_model = Sequential([
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu', input_dim=n_features),
    layers.BatchNormalization(),
    layers.Dropout(0.3),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.BatchNormalization(),
    layers.Dropout(0.2),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1)  # wRC+ prediction
])
```

#### **3. Random Forest (Stability)**
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=500,
    max_depth=20,
    min_samples_split=20,
    min_samples_leaf=10
)
```

### Final Ensemble
```python
predictions = (
    0.50 * xgb_predictions +
    0.30 * dnn_predictions +
    0.20 * rf_predictions
)
```

## ðŸ‘¥ Player Comparison System

### Similarity Metrics

#### **1. Statistical Similarity**
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Normalize stats
scaler = StandardScaler()
normalized_stats = scaler.fit_transform(player_stats)

# Find similar players
similarity_scores = cosine_similarity(prospect_vector, mlb_players_matrix)
top_10_comps = similarity_scores.argsort()[-10:]
```

#### **2. Trajectory Matching**
```python
from fastdtw import fastdtw

# Dynamic Time Warping for development paths
def find_similar_trajectories(prospect_path, mlb_paths):
    distances = []
    for mlb_path in mlb_paths:
        distance, _ = fastdtw(prospect_path, mlb_path)
        distances.append(distance)
    return np.argsort(distances)[:10]
```

#### **3. Age-Adjusted Comps**
```python
# Only compare players at same age
same_age_pool = mlb_players[mlb_players['age'] == prospect['age']]
comps = find_most_similar(prospect, same_age_pool)
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Age Curve Modeling

### Peak Performance Projection
```python
def project_peak_wrc_plus(current_wrc_plus, current_age):
    """Project peak wRC+ based on typical aging curves."""

    # Typical age curve multipliers
    age_factors = {
        20: 0.70, 21: 0.75, 22: 0.82, 23: 0.89,
        24: 0.94, 25: 0.97, 26: 0.99, 27: 1.00,  # Peak
        28: 0.99, 29: 0.97, 30: 0.94, 31: 0.90
    }

    current_factor = age_factors.get(current_age, 0.85)
    peak_factor = age_factors[27]

    # Adjust for development trajectory
    peak_projection = current_wrc_plus * (peak_factor / current_factor)

    # Add uncertainty based on age distance from peak
    years_to_peak = abs(27 - current_age)
    confidence = 1.0 - (years_to_peak * 0.1)

    return {
        'peak_wrc_plus': peak_projection,
        'confidence': confidence,
        'peak_age': 27
    }
```

## ðŸ“Š Risk Factors

### Data Limitations
- Only 11% of MiLB players have MLB outcomes
- Limited to 5 years of historical data
- Missing Statcast/TrackMan data for MiLB

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use transfer learning from MLB players
- Augment with external scouting grades
- Implement confidence intervals on predictions
- Regular model retraining as more data arrives
