## Data Completeness

### Prospects with Complete Coverage

For the 2024 season, **100% of prospects with plate appearances** have corresponding pitch-by-pitch data (126/126 prospects).

### Prospects with No Data

Approximately **821 prospects (63.4%)** have no data in the database. This is expected because:
- Many are pitchers (440 total) who don't have batting data
- Some prospects didn't play MiLB in 2023-2025 (injured, international signings, etc.)
- Some are new prospects added to the database without historical data yet

### Pitcher Data Gap

Currently, only **1 pitcher** has pitch-by-pitch data for games where they pitched (Blake Walston - 26 pitches in 2024). This represents a significant data collection opportunity:
- 440 pitchers in the database
- Most have throwing data available via the MLB Stats API
- Requires different API endpoint (`group: 'pitching'` instead of `group: 'hitting'`)

## Data Collection Notes

### What We Have
1. **Comprehensive batter data for 2024:** All prospects who played have pitch-by-pitch tracking
2. **Strong 2025 coverage:** 151 prospects with detailed pitch data
3. **Historical data:** 25+ prospects with 2023 data for year-over-year analysis

### What We Need
1. **Pitcher data collection:** System ready but needs full collection run
2. **2023 historical expansion:** Only 25 prospects currently have 2023 pitch data
3. **Play-by-play metadata:** Plate appearance data exists but could be enriched
