## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify data completeness across related tables**

   - Cross-referencing tables revealed gaps

2. **No unique constraint on mlb_player_id**
   - prospects table has unique constraint on `mlb_id`, not `mlb_player_id`
   - Simple INSERT worked better than ON CONFLICT

3. **User intuition was correct**
   - User suspected more data existed
   - Investigation confirmed 31 missing players
   - All had valuable pitch-by-pitch tracking
