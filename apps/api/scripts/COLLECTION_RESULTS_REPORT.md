### Play-by-Play Coverage
- **Total players with data**: 1,676
- **Unique games collected**: 17,469
- **Total plate appearances**: 483,769

- **Games with pitch data**: 8,225
- **Total pitches tracked**: 239,202

## Key Findings

### 1. Diacritics Issue Resolved ✓
- All 10 "missing" prospects were actually in the database with accented names
- Examples: Jesús Made (not "Jesus Made"), Josué Briceño (not "Josue Briceno")
- **Lesson learned**: Always normalize names when matching across data sources

### 2. Collection Gaps Addressed ✓
- **Before**: 41 of top 100 prospects had NO data
- **After**: Top prospects now have comprehensive 2025 season coverage
- **Focus area**: Successfully prioritized recent seasons (2024-2025)

### 3. Critical Gap Remains: Pitch-by-Pitch Data
- Only 105 batters have pitch data vs 1,676 with play-by-play
- **93% gap** in pitch-level coverage
- Top prospects still need pitch-by-pitch collection

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Expand pitch-by-pitch collection** for top 100 prospects
2. **Backfill 2024 data** for prospects who played that season
3. **Add remaining top 20** prospects with no data

### Technical Improvements Needed
1. Implement automated name normalization for matching
2. Create scheduled collection jobs for ongoing updates
