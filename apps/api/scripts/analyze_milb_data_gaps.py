Analyze MiLB Data Coverage Gaps (2021-2023)
============================================

This script identifies:
1. How much MiLB data we have for 2021-2023
2. Which prospects have MLB data but are missing MiLB data
3. Specific players we should collect MiLB data for

Goal: Expand training dataset from 20 ‚Üí 100+ samples
