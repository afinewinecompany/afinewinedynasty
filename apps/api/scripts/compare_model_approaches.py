The R² difference (0.628 → 0.213) is explained by:

1. TRAINING SET: Original used only MLB players (N≈500),
   new model uses all players (N≈5,400)

2. TARGET VALUES: Original had actual MLB outcomes,
   new model uses imputed values for 90% of players

3. EVALUATION: When evaluated on MLB players only,
   new model achieves R²≈0.599, close to original 0.628

4. BENEFIT: New approach can rank ALL prospects,
   not just those who already made MLB
