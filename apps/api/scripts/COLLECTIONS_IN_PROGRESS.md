# MiLB Pitcher Collections - IN PROGRESS

**Started:** 2025-10-19 11:32 AM
**Status:** Both collections running in parallel

## Active Collections

### 2023 Pitcher Data Collection
- **Script:** `collect_2023_pitcher_data_robust.py`
- **Target:** 436 pitchers (186 with appearances but no pitches, 250 with neither)
- **Expected Duration:** ~60-90 minutes
- **Expected Result:** ~800-1,000 pitches (minimal, due to data quality)
- **Log:** `logs/2023_pitcher_collection.log`

### 2024 Pitcher Data Collection
- **Script:** `collect_2024_pitcher_data_robust.py`
- **Target:** 440 pitchers (261 with appearances but no pitches)
- **Expected Duration:** ~60-90 minutes
- **Expected Result:** ~7,000-10,000 pitches (sparse, but better than 2023)
- **Log:** `logs/2024_pitcher_collection.log`

## Monitoring Progress

### Quick Check
```bash
cd c:/Users/lilra/myprojects/afinewinedynasty/apps/api/scripts
bash monitor_collections.sh
```

### Detailed Logs
```bash
# 2023 Progress
tail -50 logs/2023_pitcher_collection.log

# 2024 Progress
tail -50 logs/2024_pitcher_collection.log
```

### Follow Live
```bash
# Watch 2023
tail -f logs/2023_pitcher_collection.log

# Watch 2024
tail -f logs/2024_pitcher_collection.log
```

## Expected Outcomes

### What WILL Happen
- ✅ Both collections will complete without errors
- ✅ Game appearances will be inserted successfully
- ✅ Some pitches will be collected (small numbers)
- ✅ Scripts will report "COLLECTION COMPLETE"

### What WON'T Happen
- ❌ Won't collect thousands of pitches per pitcher
- ❌ Won't fill the data gaps completely
- ❌ Won't make 2023-2024 data comparable to 2025

### Why?
The MLB Stats API doesn't provide detailed pitch tracking data for most 2023-2024 MiLB games. The `pitchData` objects exist but contain NULL values.

## After Collections Complete

### 1. Verify Results
```bash
python verify_2023_2025_status.py
```

### 2. Expected Final State
```
2023 Pitcher Pitches:
  Before: 603 pitches (4 pitchers)
  After:  ~1,000 pitches (~10-15 pitchers)

2024 Pitcher Pitches:
  Before: 5,505 pitches (22 pitchers)
  After:  ~12,000 pitches (~50-80 pitchers)

2025 Pitcher Pitches:
  Current: 454,330 pitches (358 pitchers) ✅ COMPLETE
```

### 3. Next Steps
- ✅ Mark 2023-2024 as "collected" - don't re-run
- ✅ Archive 2021-2022 scripts (will never yield data)
- ✅ Focus analysis on 2025 pitch-level data
- ✅ Use game appearances for 2021-2024 historical analysis

## Understanding the Results

### If You See "0 pitches" in Logs
**This is NORMAL and EXPECTED for 2023-2024!**

The scripts are working correctly. Example from our investigation:
```
Collecting: Justin Hagenman (663795)
  -> Found 41 games ✓
  -> Fetched play-by-play data ✓
  -> Found pitcher in 8 plays ✓
  -> Extracted 38 pitch events ✓
  -> BUT: pitch_type = None, speed = None ❌
  -> Result: 0 useful pitches
```

The data simply isn't in the API.

### Success Metrics
**Don't measure by:**
- ❌ Total pitches collected for 2023-2024
- ❌ Percentage of pitchers with data

**DO measure by:**
- ✅ Scripts completed without errors
- ✅ All available data was collected
- ✅ 2025 data is complete and high-quality
- ✅ Game-level stats (appearances) are complete

## Important Notes

1. **These collections will take time** (~60-90 min each)
   - They're processing 400+ pitchers
   - Each pitcher has 20-50 games
   - Each game requires an API call

2. **Don't interrupt them** - Let them finish naturally
   - They're using exponential backoff for rate limits
   - They track progress and resume isn't implemented

3. **The results will be sparse** - This is expected
   - We're collecting what exists
   - Most of what exists is NULL data
   - This is an MLB data limitation, not a code issue

4. **This is the LAST time** we run these
   - 2023-2024: Run once, then done
   - 2021-2022: Already archived (will never work)
   - 2025: Continue monitoring as season progresses
