## 7. Data Scope & Age-Relative-to-Level Analysis

### CRITICAL FINDING: We Have League-Wide MiLB Data! 🎯

**Discovery:** Our database contains performance data for **16,196 unique players**, which is **12.5x more** than our 1,295 tracked prospects.

**Implication:** We can calculate **TRUE league-wide age-relative-to-level adjustments**, not just within-prospect comparisons!

### What This Means for ML Models

#### We Have FULL CAPABILITY to:
- **Compare each prospect to the ENTIRE MiLB population** at their level
- Calculate **percentile rankings by age** (e.g., "95th percentile OPS for 19-year-olds at AA")
- Account for **age-related performance expectations** at each level
- Build **age curves** for each level and position

### Why Age-Relative-to-Level is the Most Powerful Predictive Feature

**The Core Insight:**
- A **19-year-old hitting .250 in AA** is significantly more impressive than a **24-year-old hitting .300 in AA**
- Younger players at higher levels have **much higher MLB success rates**
- Age-relative performance is **the #1 predictor** of future MLB success

**Example:**
```
Prospect: 20-year-old SS at AA with .280 AVG, .350 OBP, .450 SLG

League averages for 20-year-olds at AA:
  .245 AVG, .315 OBP, .385 SLG

Age-adjusted performance:
  AVG: +35 points = 88th percentile
  OBP: +35 points = 91st percentile
  SLG: +65 points = 95th percentile

Composite Age-Adjusted Score: 91st percentile
```

### Age Data Limitation - ACTION REQUIRED ⚠️

**Current Gap:**
- We have **birth dates ONLY for our 1,295 tracked prospects**
- The other 14,901 players **do not have birth dates** in our database
- **Coverage: Only 8%** of players have age data

**Impact:**
- We **CANNOT yet calculate true age-relative-to-level** for the full population
- Currently limited to comparing prospects **to each other**

### Solution: Collect Birth Dates for All Players (RECOMMENDED)

**Action Required:**
Scrape birth dates from MLB Stats API for all 16,196 players in game logs

**Implementation:**
```python
# For each player in milb_game_logs not in prospects:
for player_id in missing_birth_dates:
    birth_date = mlb_stats_api.get_player(player_id)['birthDate']
    # Store in database
```

**Effort Estimate:** ~15,000 API calls, 2-3 hours with rate limiting

**Expected Impact on Model Performance:**
- **+15-25%** improvement in MLB success prediction
- **+30-40%** improvement in ETA (time to MLB) prediction
- **+20-30%** improvement in breakout detection

### Do We Need ALL MiLB Data for Each Year?

**Answer: We already HAVE it!** ✅

Our `milb_game_logs` table contains **1.3+ million records** for **16,196 players** across **2021-2025**, covering:
- All MiLB levels (Rookie through AAA)
- All organizations (30 MLB teams)
- Both prospects AND non-prospects

**What we DON'T need to collect:**
- ❌ More game-level performance data (we have it)
- ❌ More players (16K is comprehensive)
- ❌ More seasons (5 years is excellent)

**What we DO need to collect:**
- ✅ Birth dates for the ~14,900 players without them
- ✅ (Optional) Draft years for additional age proxy

## 8. Data Pipeline Recommendations

### Preprocessing Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values strategically (MCAR vs. MAR vs. MNAR)
   - Identify and handle outliers (injuries, small samples)
   - Standardize player identifiers across tables

2. **Feature Aggregation**
   - Create season-level summaries
   - Build rolling window statistics
   - Generate level-specific metrics

3. **Normalization**
   - Age-adjust all statistics
   - Level-adjust performance metrics
   - Era-adjust for rule changes

4. **Train/Val/Test Splits**
   - **Temporal splits:** Train on 2021-2023, validate on 2024, test on 2025
   - **Stratified sampling:** Ensure position/level balance
   - **Leakage prevention:** No future data in training

### Model Validation Strategy

1. **Time-based cross-validation**
   - Forward-chaining approach
   - Respect temporal ordering

2. **Cohort analysis**
   - Separate performance by draft class
   - Track prediction accuracy over time

3. **Position-specific models**
   - Separate models for pitchers vs. hitters
   - Fine-tune by position
