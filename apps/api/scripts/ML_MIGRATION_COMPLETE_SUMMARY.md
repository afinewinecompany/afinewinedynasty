## Executive Summary

Successfully migrated Fangraphs prospect grades from a unified table to separate **hitter** and **pitcher** tables, enabling machine learning model development for prospect ranking prediction.

### What Was Accomplished

1. ✅ **Dropped old `fangraphs_unified_grades` table** (10,369 rows)
2. ✅ **Created 3 new tables:**
   - `fangraphs_hitter_grades` (605 hitters, 99.3% linked to prospects)
   - `fangraphs_pitcher_grades` (671 pitchers, 99.4% linked to prospects)
   - `fangraphs_physical_attributes` (1,275 records for both hitters/pitchers)
3. ✅ **Imported 2025 Fangraphs data** from 3 CSV files
4. ✅ **Created indexes** for fast ML queries
5. ✅ **Generated migration script** for repeatability

## Example ML Query Pattern

```sql
-- Join Fangraphs grades with performance data
SELECT
    p.name,
    p.position,

    -- Fangraphs scouting grades
    fg.hit_future,
    fg.game_power_future,
    fg.speed_future,
    fg.fv as fangraphs_fv,

    -- Physical attributes
    phys.frame_grade,
    phys.athleticism_grade,

    -- MiLB performance (2024 season)
    gl.ops,
    gl.home_runs,
    gl.stolen_bases

FROM prospects p
JOIN fangraphs_hitter_grades fg
    ON p.fg_player_id = fg.fangraphs_player_id
LEFT JOIN fangraphs_physical_attributes phys
    ON p.fg_player_id = phys.fangraphs_player_id
LEFT JOIN milb_game_logs gl
    ON p.mlb_player_id = gl.mlb_player_id::varchar
WHERE gl.season = 2024
ORDER BY fg.fv DESC;
```

**Note:** `milb_game_logs.mlb_player_id` is INTEGER, while `prospects.mlb_player_id` is VARCHAR, so cast is required: `gl.mlb_player_id::varchar`

## Next Steps for Machine Learning

### 1. Data Preparation (Week 1-2)

**Priority Tasks:**
- [ ] Fix column name mappings in ML query (strikeouts vs strike_outs, etc.)
- [ ] Create age-relative percentile calculations across full MiLB population (16,196 players)
- [ ] Build season-over-season trend features (2021-2025)
- [ ] Handle missing values (birth dates, physical attributes, pitch data)

**Feature Engineering:**
- Age-adjusted performance metrics (critical!)
- Level-adjusted statistics (AAA vs Rookie)
- Time-series features (improvement trends)
- Interaction terms (hit_future × age_advantage)

### 2. Model Development (Month 1)

**Target Variables:**
1. **FV Prediction:** Predict Future Value grade (40/45/50/55/60)
2. **MLB Expectation Classification:** Multi-class prediction of MLB role
   - **All-Star** (FV 60+): Elite player, perennial All-Star candidate
   - **Regular** (FV 50-55): Above-average starter, 3-5 WAR player
   - **Part-Time** (FV 45): Platoon/rotation piece, 1-2 WAR
   - **Bench** (FV 40 or below): Backup/depth, replacement level
3. **MLB Success Metrics:** (Requires linking to MLB performance data)
   - WAR prediction (career peak and cumulative)
   - Career games played
   - Years to MLB (ETA)

**Model Types:**
- **XGBoost/LightGBM:** Best for tabular data with mixed features
- **Random Forest:** Good baseline + feature importance
- **Neural Networks:** For complex interactions
- **Ensemble:** Combine multiple models

**Validation Strategy:**
- **Temporal split:** Train 2021-2023, validate 2024, test 2025
- **Cross-validation:** 5-fold within each season
- **Position-specific models:** Separate models for hitters/pitchers

### 3. Model Evaluation

**Metrics:**
- **Regression (FV prediction):** RMSE, MAE, R²
- **Classification (Top 100):** AUC-ROC, Precision/Recall
- **Calibration:** Compare model FV to scouting FV
- **Feature importance:** Which features matter most?

**Validation Against Scouting:**
- Correlation with Fangraphs FV
- Agreement on Top 100 prospects
- Identify scouting blind spots (model disagrees → investigate)

### 4. Production Deployment

- API endpoint for real-time predictions
- Automated retraining on new data
- Monitoring dashboard
- Integration with A Fine Wine Dynasty rankings

## Data Quality Notes

### Successful Imports

✅ **1,320 hitters imported** (1 skipped due to age overflow)
✅ **696 pitchers imported** (100% with pitch grades)
✅ **1,321 physical attribute records imported**

### Known Issues

1. **One hitter skipped:** Age value > 999.99 (precision 5,2 limit)
2. **Foreign key constraints removed:** `prospects.fg_player_id` lacks UNIQUE constraint
   - Workaround: Manual JOINs work fine
3. **Column name mismatches** in `milb_game_logs`:
   - Use `on_base_pct` not `obp`
   - Use `slugging_pct` not `slg`
   - Use `strikeouts` not `strike_outs`
   - Use `rbi` not `runs_batted_in`

### Linkage Quality

- **99.3%** of hitters linked to prospects table
- **99.4%** of pitchers linked to prospects table
- **1,270** prospects have Fangraphs IDs (out of 1,318 total)
