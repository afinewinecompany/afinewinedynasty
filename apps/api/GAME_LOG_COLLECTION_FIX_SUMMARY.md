# GAME LOG COLLECTION FIX - SUMMARY

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Issue:** Missing MiLB game logs and pitch data for prospects

---

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The `collect_milb_game_logs.py` script was **NOT using the `sportId` parameter** when querying the MLB Stats API. This caused the API to only return MLB games, not MiLB games at specific levels (AA, AAA, A+, A, etc.).

### Technical Details

**Problematic API Call:**
```python
# OLD METHOD (missing sportId)
response = await api_client.get_player_game_logs(
    player_id=player_id_int,
    season=season,
    game_type="R"  # Regular season only
)
```

**Fixed API Call:**
```python
# NEW METHOD (with sportId)
url = f"https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/people/{player_id}/stats"
params = {
    'stats': 'gameLog',
    'group': 'hitting',
    'season': season,
    'sportId': sport_id,  # ← CRITICAL FIX
    'gameType': 'R'
}
```

---

## SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Created Fixed Collection Script

File: [collect_bryce_all_gamelogs_fixed.py](collect_bryce_all_gamelogs_fixed.py)

**Key Features:**
- Queries each sport level separately using `sportId` parameter
- Maps sport IDs to level names:
  - 11 → AAA
  - 12 → AA
  - 13 → A+
  - 14 → A
  - 15 → Rk
  - 16 → FRk
  - 586 → FCL
  - 5442 → Complex

- Fixed ON CONFLICT clause to use correct constraint: `(game_pk, mlb_player_id)`

### 2. Successfully Collected Game Logs

**Bryce Eldridge - Pitch Collection Results:**

| Level | Pitches Collected |
|-------|-------------------|
| AA | 573 |
| AAA | 1,165 |

## DATABASE SCHEMA ISSUES FOUND

### Issue 1: ON CONFLICT Constraint

**Error:**
```
there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification
```

**Root Cause:**
- Script used: `ON CONFLICT (mlb_player_id, game_pk, season)`
- Actual constraint: `uq_milb_game_logs_game_player (game_pk, mlb_player_id)`

**Fix Applied:**
```sql
ON CONFLICT (game_pk, mlb_player_id)  -- Correct order
DO UPDATE SET
    updated_at = now(),
    batting_avg = EXCLUDED.batting_avg,
    ops = EXCLUDED.ops,
    level = EXCLUDED.level  -- Added to update level if changed
```

### Issue 2: Invalid Level Values

**Error:**
```
new row for relation "milb_game_logs" violates check constraint "valid_level"
DETAIL: Failing row contains (..., FRk, ...)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Database has CHECK constraint on level column
- Allowed values: AAA, AA, A+, A, Rookie, Rookie+, Complex, Winter, DSL, ACL, FCL
- API returns 'FRk' (Foreign Rookie) which is NOT in the allowed list

**Temporary Workaround:**
- Script logs error for FRk games but continues
- FRk games are Complex League games with different naming

**Recommended Fix:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE milb_game_logs DROP CONSTRAINT valid_level;
ALTER TABLE milb_game_logs ADD CONSTRAINT valid_level CHECK (
    level IN ('AAA', 'AA', 'A+', 'A', 'Rookie', 'Rookie+', 'Complex', 'Winter',
              'DSL', 'ACL', 'FCL', 'FRk', 'Rk')  -- Added FRk and Rk
);
```

## NEXT STEPS

### 1. Fix Main Game Log Collection Script

Update [apps/api/scripts/collect_milb_game_logs.py](apps/api/scripts/collect_milb_game_logs.py) to:

1. Query each sport level separately using `sportId` parameter
2. Fix ON CONFLICT clause to use `(game_pk, mlb_player_id)`
3. Update level field from API response

**Implementation Plan:**

```python
async def collect_player_game_logs(self, api_client, db, prospect_id, mlb_player_id, name, position):
    """Collect game logs for a single player across all specified seasons."""

    player_id_int = int(mlb_player_id)

    SPORT_LEVELS = {
        11: 'AAA',
        12: 'AA',
        13: 'A+',
        14: 'A',
        15: 'Rk',
        16: 'FRk',
        586: 'FCL',
        5442: 'Complex'
    }

    for season in self.seasons:
        for sport_id, level_name in SPORT_LEVELS.items():
            # Query MLB API with sportId parameter
            response = await api_client.get_player_game_logs_by_sport(
                player_id=player_id_int,
                season=season,
                sport_id=sport_id,  # ← KEY FIX
                game_type="R"
            )

            games_saved = self.save_game_logs(
                db, prospect_id, player_id_int, season, level_name, response
            )
```

### 2. Add MLBAPIClient Method

Add new method to `MLBAPIClient` class:

```python
async def get_player_game_logs_by_sport(
    self,
    player_id: int,
    season: int,
    sport_id: int,
    game_type: str = "R"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get game logs for specific sport level.

    Args:
        player_id: MLB player ID
        season: Season year
        sport_id: Sport ID (11=AAA, 12=AA, 13=A+, 14=A, etc.)
        game_type: Game type (R=Regular, S=Spring, P=Playoffs)

    Returns:
        API response with game log data
    """
    url = f"{self.base_url}/people/{player_id}/stats"
    params = {
        'stats': 'gameLog',
        'group': 'hitting',
        'season': season,
        'sportId': sport_id,
        'gameType': game_type
    }

    return await self._make_request(url, params)
```

### 3. Update Database Constraint

Add missing level values to CHECK constraint:

```sql
ALTER TABLE milb_game_logs DROP CONSTRAINT valid_level;
ALTER TABLE milb_game_logs ADD CONSTRAINT valid_level CHECK (
    level IN (
        'AAA', 'AA', 'A+', 'A',
        'Rookie', 'Rookie+', 'Rk',
        'Complex', 'Winter',
        'DSL', 'ACL', 'FCL', 'FRk'
    )
);
```

### 4. Run Full Collection for All Prospects

Once the main script is fixed, run collection for all prospects:

```bash
cd apps/api/scripts
python collect_milb_game_logs.py --seasons 2025 2024 2023
```

### 5. Collect Pitch Data for All Prospects

After game logs are complete, run pitch data collection:

```bash
cd apps/api/scripts
python backfill_from_gamelogs_2025.py
```

## LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Always use sportId parameter** when querying MLB Stats API for MiLB data
2. **Verify database constraints** before writing INSERT/UPDATE queries
3. **Check API response structure** - sport level can be in multiple places:
   - `split.sport.id` (at split level)
   - `split.game.sport.id` (at game level - but often empty!)
4. **Use correct constraint names** in ON CONFLICT clauses
5. **Plan for missing data** - not all levels/seasons will have data for every player
