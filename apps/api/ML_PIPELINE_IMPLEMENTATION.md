```

## Key Predictions

### Primary Targets
1. **wRC+** (Weighted Runs Created Plus)
   - League and park adjusted
   - 100 = league average
   - Range typically 50-200

2. **wOBA** (Weighted On-Base Average)
   - Linear weights-based metric
   - Typical range: .200-.450
   - League average ~.320

3. **Peak wRC+**
   - Age-adjusted ceiling projection
   - Typically occurs age 26-28
   - Accounts for development potential

## Usage Examples

### Training Models
```python
from train_projection_model import ProjectionModelTrainer

trainer = ProjectionModelTrainer(target='wrc_plus')
model_package = await trainer.train_full_pipeline()
```

### Getting Projections
```python
from projection_api import ProjectionAPI

api = ProjectionAPI()
await api.initialize()
projection = await api.get_full_projection(player_id=12345)
```
