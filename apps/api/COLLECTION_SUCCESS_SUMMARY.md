# MiLB Data Collection - Success Summary

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Problem Solved

Original issue: Missing MiLB pitch-by-pitch data for key prospects
- Konnor Griffin: Had 168 pitches, needed 2,080
- Bryce Eldridge: Had 0 pitches, needed 1,746

**Root Cause:** `collect_milb_game_logs.py` was NOT using `sportId` parameter, causing MLB API to only return MLB games instead of MiLB games at specific levels.

## Technical Solution

### Fixed Script: `collect_milb_game_logs_fixed.py`

**Key Changes:**

1. **Query each sport level separately using sportId:**
```python
SPORT_LEVELS = {
    11: 'AAA',
    12: 'AA',
    13: 'A+',
    14: 'A',
    16: 'FRk',
}

for sport_id, level_name in SPORT_LEVELS.items():
    url = f"https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/people/{player_id}/stats"
    params = {
        'stats': 'gameLog',
        'group': 'hitting',
        'season': season,
        'sportId': sport_id,  # CRITICAL FIX
        'gameType': 'R'
    }
```

2. **Fixed database connection:** Direct psycopg2 instead of SQLAlchemy
3. **Fixed ON CONFLICT:** Uses correct constraint `(game_pk, mlb_player_id)`
4. **Proper error handling:** Catches constraint violations, continues on errors

### Parallel Collection Strategy

Three processes running simultaneously:
1. **Game Log Collection** - Queries MLB API for all game logs by sport level
2. **Batter Pitch Collection** - Extracts pitch data where prospect was BATTING
3. **Pitcher Pitch Collection** - Extracts pitch data where prospect was PITCHING
