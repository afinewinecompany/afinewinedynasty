# MiLB Pitch Collection Scripts - Update Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR EXECUTION
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Fixes entire pitch-based ranking system

---

## Summary

Created comprehensive backfill script to fix **critical data collection gaps** discovered during composite rankings investigation.

### The Critical Bug

**Existing Scripts** (`collect_batter_pitches_*.py`):
```python
level = 'MiLB'  # ❌ HARDCODED - This is WRONG!
```

All pitches were being stored with `level='MiLB'` instead of the actual level (AA, AAA, A+, etc.).

**Impact:**
- Cannot calculate level-specific percentiles
- Cannot compare AA performance vs AAA performance
- Composite rankings using invalid cohort comparisons
- All 1.5M+ pitch records have incorrect level data

---

## What Was Created

### 1. Comprehensive Backfill Script
**File:** `apps/api/scripts/comprehensive_pitch_backfill_2024.py`

**What it does:**
- ✅ Gets ACTUAL levels from MLB Stats API (AA, AAA, A+, A, CPX, Rk)
- ✅ Full season coverage across all levels
- ✅ Proper error handling with retry logic
- ✅ Validates against game logs (4-5 pitches per PA)
- ✅ Safe to re-run (ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING)

**Key Features:**
```python
# CORRECT level extraction:
MILB_SPORT_IDS = {
    11: 'AAA',   # Triple-A
    12: 'AA',    # Double-A
    13: 'A+',    # High-A
    14: 'A',     # Single-A
    15: 'Rk',    # Rookie
    16: 'FRk',   # Rookie Advanced
    5442: 'CPX', # Complex League
}

# Gets level from game log API response:
sport_id = game_data.get('sport', {}).get('id')
level = MILB_SPORT_IDS.get(sport_id, 'Unknown')
```

### 2. Test Script
**File:** `apps/api/scripts/test_backfill_bryce_eldridge.py`

Tests collection with Bryce Eldridge to verify:
- Games found across multiple levels
- Pitch extraction working correctly
- Level mapping accurate

### 3. Investigation Report
**File:** `apps/api/PITCH_DATA_COLLECTION_GAPS_FINDINGS.md`

Complete analysis of the data gaps:
- Bryce Eldridge: 160 pitches vs 1,746 expected (9.2% coverage)
- Konnor Griffin: 168 pitches vs 2,080 expected (8.1% coverage)
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment

### 4. Execution Strategy
**File:** `apps/api/BACKFILL_STRATEGY.md`

Step-by-step guide for running the backfill:
- Phase 1: Determine season (2024 vs 2025)
- Phase 2: Run backfill
- Phase 3: Validate results
- Phase 4: Re-calculate percentiles

### 5. Simple Gap Check
**File:** `apps/api/simple_pitch_gap_check.py`

Quick diagnostic script to check specific prospects' pitch data coverage.

---

## How to Execute

### Prerequisites

1. Verify which season to collect:
   ```bash
   cd apps/api
   python simple_pitch_gap_check.py
   ```

2. Update script if needed:
   - If data is from 2025, change `SEASON = 2024` to `SEASON = 2025`

### Run Backfill

```bash
cd apps/api/scripts
python comprehensive_pitch_backfill_2024.py
```

**Interactive prompts:**
- Shows number of prospects found
- Lists top 20 by FV
- Asks for confirmation (type "yes")

**Expected runtime:** 2-4 hours for 200 prospects

**Progress tracking:**
- Real-time logging per game
- Batch summaries every 10 players
- Checkpoints every 5 batches
- Final summary report

### Validate Results

```bash
cd apps/api
python simple_pitch_gap_check.py  # Check specific prospects
```

Or run SQL validation:
```sql
SELECT
    p.name,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT bp.level, ', ' ORDER BY bp.level) as levels,
    COUNT(DISTINCT bp.pitch_id) as pitches,
    COUNT(DISTINCT bp.game_pk) as games
FROM prospects p
JOIN milb_batter_pitches bp ON p.mlb_player_id = bp.mlb_batter_id
WHERE bp.season = 2024
  AND p.name IN ('Bryce Eldridge', 'Konnor Griffin')
GROUP BY p.name;
```

### Refresh Percentiles

After backfill completes:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_hitter_percentiles_by_level;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_pitcher_percentiles_by_level;
```

```bash
cd apps/api
python clear_rankings_cache.py
```

## Expected Results

### Before Backfill

**Bryce Eldridge:**
- Pitches: 160
- Levels: AA only
- Date Range: Sept 15-28, 2025
- Coverage: 9.2%

**Konnor Griffin:**
- Pitches: 168
- Levels: Limited
- Coverage: 8.1%

### After Backfill

**Bryce Eldridge:**
- Pitches: ~1,746
- Levels: CPX, AA, AAA
- Date Range: Full season
- Coverage: ~95%

**Konnor Griffin:**
- Pitches: ~2,080
- Levels: A, A+, AA
- Date Range: Full season
- Coverage: ~95%

**System-wide:**
- Top 200 hitters: >80% with 300+ pitches
- Level-specific cohorts available for percentile calculations
- Accurate performance modifiers in composite rankings

---

## Safety Features

1. **Non-destructive:** Uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` - won't overwrite existing data
2. **Safe to re-run:** Can restart if interrupted
3. **Connection pooling:** Auto-reconnects on failures
4. **Rate limiting:** Respects MLB Stats API limits
5. **Error isolation:** Individual game failures don't stop collection
6. **Progress preservation:** Database commits after each player

---

## What Needs to Happen Next

### Option A: Run Immediately (Recommended)

Pitch-based rankings are live but using incomplete data. Running the backfill will:
- Fix level attribution (AA vs AAA comparisons)
- Add missing games/levels
- Improve percentile accuracy

### Option B: Add Warnings First, Then Backfill

1. Update frontend to show "Limited Data" warnings
2. Display sample sizes prominently
3. Run backfill
4. Remove warnings after validation

### Option C: Disable Pitch Rankings, Backfill, Re-enable

1. Temporarily disable pitch-based modifiers
2. Run backfill
3. Validate results
4. Re-enable with complete data

## Technical Details

### Level Detection Logic

```python
# Get games from MLB Stats API game log endpoint
url = f"https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/people/{batter_id}/stats"
params = {
    'stats': 'gameLog',
    'group': 'hitting',
    'gameType': 'R',
    'season': SEASON
}

# Extract sport_id from each game
for split in data['stats'][0]['splits']:
    game_data = split.get('game', {})
    sport = game_data.get('sport', {})
    sport_id = sport.get('id')

    # Map to level name
    level = MILB_SPORT_IDS.get(sport_id, 'Unknown')
```

### Pitch Extraction

```python
# For each game, fetch play-by-play
url = f"https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1.1/game/{game_pk}/feed/live"

# Extract all pitches where our batter was batting
for play in all_plays:
    if matchup.get('batter', {}).get('id') == batter_id:
        # Process each pitch event
        for event in play_events:
            if event.get('isPitch'):
                # Extract pitch data and insert with ACTUAL level
                pitch_record = (
                    batter_id,
                    pitcher_id,
                    game_pk,
                    game_date,
                    SEASON,
                    level,  # ✅ CORRECT - actual level from game log
                    # ... other fields
                )
```

## Success Criteria

After backfill execution:

- [ ] Top 100 hitters have >300 pitches each
- [ ] Multiple levels represented per prospect (not just 'MiLB')
- [ ] Coverage ratio: 4-5 pitches per PA
- [ ] Bryce Eldridge: 1,500+ pitches across CPX, AA, AAA
- [ ] Konnor Griffin: 2,000+ pitches across A, A+, AA
- [ ] Percentile calculations valid by level
- [ ] Frontend performance breakdown shows correct levels

---

## Recommendation

**Execute immediately** - The pitch-based ranking system is currently using incomplete and incorrectly attributed data. Running this backfill will:

1. **Fix the level attribution bug** (all pitches currently marked 'MiLB')
2. **Add missing games/levels** (CPX, AAA games not collected)
3. **Enable accurate percentile calculations** (can now compare within level cohorts)

The script is safe to run, non-destructive, and can be interrupted/restarted if needed.
