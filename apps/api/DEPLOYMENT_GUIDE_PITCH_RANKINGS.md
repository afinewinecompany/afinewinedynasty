```
Rank  Name                      Pos  FV    Comp  Perf Mod  Source
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1     Jes√∫s Made                SS   65.0  66.0      +0.0  pitch_data
2     Konnor Griffin            SS   65.0  66.0      +0.0  pitch_data

## What's Working

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality
- Materialized views refreshed and populated
- Pitch data aggregation working for hitters and pitchers
- Percentile calculations accurate
- Weighted composite scoring functional
- Performance modifier integration complete

### ‚úÖ Data Coverage
- **621 batters** with pitch-level tracking
- **363 pitchers** with pitch-level tracking
- **710 total players** in percentile cohorts (2025 season)
- Graceful fallback for prospects without pitch data

### ‚úÖ Performance
- Materialized views provide fast lookups
- End-to-end ranking generation works
- System handles missing data without errors

---

## What Needs Attention

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues (Non-blocking)

1. **Some prospects missing level/player_id**
   - Impact: They fall back to FV-only rankings
   - Fix: Data cleanup task for prospects table
   - Priority: Low

2. **Limited 2025 pitch data so far**
   - Impact: Some prospects use game log fallback
   - Fix: More data will accumulate through season
   - Priority: Low (will improve naturally)

---

## Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Up Daily Materialized View Refresh

**Option A: Cron Job (Linux/Mac)**
```bash
# Add to crontab (crontab -e)
0 3 * * * psql "postgresql://postgres:BVQjtsVwITqJKqdwOhgRLQwaWdeTXKgp@nozomi.proxy.rlwy.net:39235/railway" -c "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_hitter_percentiles_by_level; REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_pitcher_percentiles_by_level;"
```

**Option B: Python Script (Cross-platform)**
Create `scripts/refresh_percentile_views.py`:
```python
import asyncio
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine
from sqlalchemy import text

DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:BVQjtsVwITqJKqdwOhgRLQwaWdeTXKgp@nozomi.proxy.rlwy.net:39235/railway"

async def refresh_views():
    engine = create_async_engine(DATABASE_URL)
    async with engine.begin() as conn:
        await conn.execute(text("REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_hitter_percentiles_by_level;"))
        await conn.execute(text("REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_pitcher_percentiles_by_level;"))
    print("Views refreshed successfully")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(refresh_views())
```

Then schedule with Windows Task Scheduler or cron.

### 2. Update API Documentation

The `/v1/prospects/composite-rankings` endpoint now returns:

```json
{
  "rank": 1,
  "name": "Jes√∫s Made",
  "composite_score": 66.0,
  "scores": {
    "base_fv": 65.0,
    "performance_modifier": 0.0,
    "performance_breakdown": {
      "source": "pitch_data",
      "composite_percentile": 56.8,
      "metrics": {
        "exit_velo_90th": 98.5,
        "hard_hit_rate": 42.3,
        ...
      },
      "percentiles": {
        "exit_velo_90th": 85.2,
        "hard_hit_rate": 78.5,
        ...
      },
      "weighted_contributions": {
        "exit_velo_90th": 21.30,
        "hard_hit_rate": 15.70,
        ...
      },
      "sample_size": 234,
      "days_covered": 60,
      "level": "AA"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Frontend Updates (Optional Enhancement)

Consider displaying:
- **Performance source** (pitch data vs game logs)
- **Metric breakdowns** (exit velo, whiff rate, etc.)
- **Sample size** to indicate confidence
- **Percentile badges** for key metrics

Example UI:
```
Jackson Holliday - SS - Rank #1
Composite: 68.5 | FV: 65.0 | Adjustment: +3.5

Performance Modifier: +5.0 (92nd percentile)
Source: Pitch Data (234 pitches, last 60 days, AA)

Key Metrics:
- Exit Velocity: 105.2 mph (95th %ile) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Hard Hit Rate: 48.5% (92nd %ile) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Contact Rate: 82.1% (88th %ile) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
- Whiff Rate: 18.3% (85th %ile) ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Weekly Checks
- Monitor materialized view refresh success
- Check percentage of prospects using pitch data vs fallback
- Review query performance

### Monthly Reviews
- Analyze user feedback on ranking accuracy
- Fine-tune metric weights if needed
- Review percentile distributions by level

### Quarterly Tasks
- Add new pitch metrics as data becomes available
- Consider position-specific weightings
- Evaluate correlation with actual MLB success

---

## Performance Benchmarks

From testing:
- **View refresh time:** ~5 seconds
- **Ranking generation (top 10):** ~2 seconds
- **Cache-able:** Yes (30 min TTL recommended)

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

```bash
# Rollback migration
cd apps/api
alembic downgrade -1

# This will:
# 1. Drop materialized views
# 2. Revert to old performance modifier logic
```

Old system remains intact in `ProspectRankingService._estimate_percentile()`.

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Technical:**
- Materialized views refresh daily without errors
- Query performance < 5s for full rankings
- >40% of prospects using pitch data (currently: varies by position)

‚úÖ **Business:**
- Rankings differentiate prospects with same FV
- Users understand performance breakdowns
- System identifies breakout candidates

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Schedule Daily Refresh ‚è∞
Set up cron job or task scheduler for materialized view refresh.

### 2. Monitor in Production üìä
- Watch logs for any errors
- Track percentage of pitch data usage
- Gather user feedback

### 3. Optional Enhancements üöÄ
- Add frontend UI for metric breakdowns
- Create admin dashboard for monitoring
- Add position-specific weights
