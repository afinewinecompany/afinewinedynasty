## League Factors Summary (2024 Season)

| Level | OPS  | Avg Age | Med Age | Players |
|-------|------|---------|---------|---------|
| A     | .686 | 21.3    | 21.2    | 890     |
| A+    | .686 | 22.7    | 22.7    | 660     |
| AA    | .675 | 24.6    | 24.5    | 663     |
| AAA   | .773 | 27.2    | 26.8    | 787     |

### Key Insights:
- **AAA has highest OPS** (.773) - most offensive environment
- **Age progression is clear:** A (21.3) â†’ A+ (22.7) â†’ AA (24.6) â†’ AAA (27.2)
- **Level difficulty varies:** AA is toughest relative environment (lowest OPS despite higher level than A+)

## Position Factors Summary (2024 Season)

### By Position Group:

**CATCHERS (C):**
- AAA: .740 OPS, Age 28.2
- AA: .653 OPS, Age 25.0
- A+: .668 OPS, Age 23.0
- A: .670 OPS, Age 21.7

**INFIELDERS (IF):**
- AAA: .775 OPS, Age 27.1
- AA: .673 OPS, Age 24.6
- A+: .687 OPS, Age 22.5
- A: .679 OPS, Age 21.2

**OUTFIELDERS (OF):**
- AAA: .785 OPS, Age 26.9
- AA: .688 OPS, Age 24.4
- A+: .693 OPS, Age 22.7
- A: .701 OPS, Age 21.3

### Key Insights:
- **Catchers hit worst** at every level (expected - defensive demands)
- **Outfielders hit best** at every level (less defensive fatigue)
- **OPS gap at AA:** C (.653) vs OF (.688) = 35 points
- **Age differences:** Catchers are typically 0.5-1.5 years older than OF at same level

## ML Feature Engineering Impact

### New Features Now Available:

#### 1. Level-Adjusted Stats
```python
ops_vs_league = player_ops / league_ops_at_level
# Example: .720 OPS at AA / .675 league OPS = 1.067 (6.7% above average)
```

#### 2. Age-Relative Performance
```python
age_vs_league_avg = player_age - league_avg_age_at_level
# Example: 22.0 years at AA - 24.6 avg = -2.6 years (ELITE age for level)
```

#### 3. Position-Adjusted Stats
```python
ops_vs_position = player_ops / position_ops_at_level
# Example: Catcher .700 OPS / .653 C avg = 1.072 (7.2% above position peers)
```

#### 4. Comprehensive Adjustment
```python
fully_adjusted_ops = raw_ops * level_factor * age_factor * position_factor
# Accounts for ALL context in single metric
```

## Real-World Example: Why This Matters

### Player A: 22yo Catcher hitting .720 OPS at AA

**WITHOUT Adjustments:**
- Raw OPS: .720
- League avg at AA: .675
- League-relative: .720/.675 = 1.067 (6.7% above average)
- **Verdict:** Slightly above average hitter

**WITH Adjustments:**
1. **Level adjustment:** .720 / .675 = 1.067
2. **Age adjustment:** 22yo vs 24.6 avg = -2.6 years younger (elite)
3. **Position adjustment:** .720 / .653 (C avg) = 1.103 (10% above position)

**Fully Adjusted OPS:** .720 Ã— 1.0 Ã— 1.052 (age) Ã— 1.103 (position) = .836

**Verdict:** ELITE prospect (top-tier hitting catcher who's 2.6 years younger than peers)

## Next Steps for ML Model

### 1. Update Feature Engineering Script
- Add league-relative features (ops_vs_league, bb_rate_vs_league, etc.)
- Add age-relative features (age_vs_league_avg, age_percentile)
- Add position-relative features (ops_vs_position)
- Create fully_adjusted_ops composite metric

### 2. Retrain Models
```bash
cd apps/api
python scripts/train_all_players_predictor.py --include-league-factors --include-position-factors
```

### 3. Expected Performance Gains
- **Current RÂ²:** 0.31 (wRC+)
- **With league/position factors:** 0.38-0.42 (projected)
- **With Statcast (when ready):** 0.45-0.50 (projected)

### 4. Feature Importance Changes Expected
- Current top feature: avg_ops (31.4%)
- Expected new top features:
  - fully_adjusted_ops (25-30%)
  - age_vs_league_avg (8-12%)
  - ops_vs_position (6-10%)
  - highest_level_ops_adjusted (8-10%)
