# A Fine Wine Dynasty Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable dynasty fantasy baseball players to make data-driven prospect evaluation decisions in under 1 hour per week (down from 5+ hours)
- Provide ML-powered prospect rankings that outperform industry standard prediction accuracy by 20% (targeting 65% vs 45% baseline)
- Create unified prospect evaluation platform consolidating 4+ data sources into actionable dynasty-specific rankings
- Generate $50K ARR within 12 months through freemium subscription model with 1,000+ active users
- Establish competitive moats through comprehensive historical data advantage and predictive modeling infrastructure

### Background Context

Dynasty fantasy baseball players face critical information asymmetry when evaluating minor league prospects. Current prospect evaluation requires manually synthesizing data from multiple sources (Fangraphs, MLB Pipeline, Statcast), interpreting inconsistent scouting grades, and attempting to predict major league success without historical context or predictive modeling. This creates analysis paralysis where competitive players spend 3-8 hours weekly researching prospects manually across fragmented platforms.

A Fine Wine Dynasty solves this through a machine learning-powered prospect evaluation engine that combines 15+ years of historical minor league â†’ major league transition data with real-time performance statistics and scouting grades. The platform transforms scattered, hard-to-interpret prospect data into actionable dynasty-specific rankings, enabling competitive dynasty players to maintain strategic advantages while dramatically reducing research time investment.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Clean, data-driven interface optimized for quick decision-making by fantasy baseball experts. The design should feel professional and analytical (like financial trading platforms) while remaining accessible on mobile devices. Primary focus on information density without overwhelming casual users, with clear visual hierarchy emphasizing prospect rankings and key decision factors.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Dashboard-first approach**: Prospect rankings as primary landing page with powerful filtering
- **Quick comparison workflows**: Side-by-side prospect analysis with key metrics highlighted
- **Progressive disclosure**: Basic rankings visible to all, detailed analytics for premium users
- **Mobile-responsive gestures**: Swipe for prospect comparisons, pull-to-refresh for rankings updates
- **Search-driven discovery**: Fuzzy search for prospect names with auto-complete

### Core Screens and Views
- **Prospect Rankings Dashboard**: Filterable top 500 list with key metrics columns
- **Individual Prospect Profile**: Detailed stats, scouting grades, ML prediction, and historical comparisons
- **Comparison Tool**: Side-by-side analysis of multiple prospects
- **User Account/Subscription Management**: Registration, billing, Fantrax integration setup

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Targeting WCAG AA compliance for broader user accessibility, ensuring color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility for prospect data tables and charts.

### Branding
Professional sports analytics aesthetic with baseball-inspired design elements. Color palette emphasizing data visualization best practices (avoiding red/green for colorblind users), with clean typography prioritizing readability of numerical data and statistics.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Mobile-first responsive web application optimizing for both desktop research sessions (detailed analysis) and mobile quick-reference usage (checking rankings, prospect updates). Native mobile apps deferred to Phase 2 based on user feedback and engagement patterns.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Following the detailed structure outlined in the Project Brief with separate apps for web (Next.js), API (FastAPI), and ML pipeline, while maintaining shared packages for types, database schemas, and utilities.

### Service Architecture
Microservices within a monorepo approach - separate services for API Gateway (Kong/AWS API Gateway), Data Ingestion Service, ML Inference Service, User Service, and future Notification Service. This provides scalability while maintaining development efficiency for a solo founder initially.

### Testing Requirements
Full testing pyramid including unit tests (pytest for backend, Jest for frontend), integration tests for API endpoints and data pipeline, and basic e2e testing for critical user workflows. Manual testing convenience methods needed for ML model validation and data quality verification.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Frontend Stack**: React 18+ with TypeScript 5.0+, Next.js 14 for SSR/SSG, Zustand for state management, Tailwind CSS with Headless UI
- **Backend Stack**: FastAPI 0.100+ with async capabilities, scikit-learn for ML models, Celery with Redis for background tasks
- **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL 15+ with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data, Redis for caching, Elasticsearch for prospect search
- **ML Infrastructure**: SHAP for model explainability, weekly model retraining during active seasons, feature store for consistent feature engineering
- **Data Integration**: Apache Airflow for pipeline orchestration, rate limiting compliance (1 req/sec for Fangraphs), comprehensive error handling and monitoring
- **Security Requirements**: JWT authentication, AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, GDPR compliance endpoints
- **Infrastructure**: AWS/GCP with containerization (Docker/ECS), CloudFront CDN, comprehensive monitoring with DataDog/Sentry
- **Performance Targets**: Sub-3 second page loads, Redis caching with 30-minute TTL for rankings, database query optimization with strategic indexing

**Areas for Architect Investigation**:
- Historical data pipeline architecture for 50K+ prospect records
- ML model serving infrastructure with <500ms response times
- Real-time ranking update architecture

### Recommendations

**Before Architecture Phase**:
1. Document primary user journey flows (registration â†’ rankings â†’ prospect analysis â†’ decision)
2. Clarify historical data migration strategy and timeline
3. Define specific MVP learning goals and success criteria

**During Architecture Phase**:
1. Deep dive on ML pipeline architecture for scale and performance
