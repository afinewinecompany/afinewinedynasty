SELECT p.name, p.position, mp.predicted_tier, mp.predicted_fv, mp.confidence_score
FROM ml_predictions mp
INNER JOIN prospects p ON p.id = mp.prospect_id
WHERE mp.model_version = 'v1.0'
ORDER BY mp.predicted_fv DESC, mp.confidence_score DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Compare predictions vs actual scouting
SELECT p.name,
       sg.future_value as actual_fv,
       mp.predicted_fv,
       ABS(mp.predicted_fv - sg.future_value) as diff,
       mp.confidence_score
FROM ml_predictions mp
INNER JOIN prospects p ON p.id = mp.prospect_id
INNER JOIN scouting_grades sg ON sg.prospect_id = p.id
