# 4. Interaction Design

## 4.1 Key Interaction Paradigms

### Dashboard-First Approach
**Philosophy:** Prospect rankings serve as the primary entry point and navigation hub
- **Landing Experience:** Users immediately see actionable prospect rankings
- **Quick Access:** One-click access to filtering, search, and prospect details
- **Context Preservation:** Filters and sort preferences persist across sessions
- **Progressive Loading:** Initial load shows top 25, lazy loading for additional prospects

**Implementation Specifications:**
```
Initial Load Sequence:
1. Authentication check (100ms)
2. User preference retrieval (200ms)
3. Top 25 prospect rankings (300ms)
4. Filter options and metadata (400ms)
5. Additional prospects on scroll (on-demand)
```

### Quick Comparison Workflows
**Philosophy:** Enable rapid side-by-side analysis to accelerate decision-making
- **Selection Methods:** Multiple entry points (checkboxes, quick-add buttons, drag-drop)
- **Comparison States:** 2-prospect minimum, 4-prospect maximum
- **Visual Differentiation:** Clear advantage indicators and difference highlighting
- **Export Integration:** One-click export for external analysis

**Interaction Flow:**
```
Comparison Initiation:
├── From Rankings: Select multiple prospects → "Compare Selected" button
├── From Profile: "Add to Comparison" → Select additional prospects
└── From Search: Filter results → Multi-select → Quick compare

Comparison Interface:
├── Metric-by-metric comparison with visual indicators
├── AI-generated summary of key differences
├── Interactive elements (charts, graphs, detailed breakdowns)
└── Action items (export, share, add to watchlist)
```

### Progressive Disclosure
**Philosophy:** Layer information complexity based on user tier and engagement level
- **Free Tier:** Top 100 prospects, basic metrics, limited filtering
- **Premium Tier:** Full rankings, advanced analytics, unlimited features
- **Information Depth:** Summary → Details → Advanced Analytics → Historical Data

**Disclosure Hierarchy:**
```
Level 1 (Always Visible):
├── Prospect name, position, organization
├── ML prediction with confidence
├── ETA and age
└── Current level and basic stats

Level 2 (Click/Hover):
├── Detailed current season statistics
├── Scouting grades from multiple sources
├── Recent performance trends
└── AI-generated outlook summary

Level 3 (Premium/Detailed View):
├── Multi-year statistical progression
├── Advanced metrics and ratios
├── Historical analog comparisons
└── Comprehensive analysis tools
```

### Mobile-Responsive Gestures
**Philosophy:** Optimize for touch interaction and one-handed mobile usage
- **Swipe Navigation:** Horizontal swipes between prospect profiles
- **Pull-to-Refresh:** Update rankings and prospect data
- **Quick Actions:** Long-press for contextual menus
- **Touch Targets:** Minimum 44px for all interactive elements

**Gesture Implementation:**
```
Primary Gestures:
├── Swipe Left/Right: Navigate between prospects in comparison or profile view
├── Pull Down: Refresh rankings data
├── Long Press: Quick action menu (add to watchlist, compare, share)
├── Pinch/Zoom: Statistical charts and graphs
└── Double Tap: Quick add to comparison queue

Secondary Gestures:
├── Swipe Up: Load more prospects (rankings page)
├── Swipe Down: Collapse expanded sections
└── Three-finger Tap: Advanced user features (power users)
```

## 4.2 Search-Driven Discovery
**Philosophy:** Enable fuzzy, intelligent search to help users find relevant prospects

**Search Capabilities:**
- **Fuzzy Matching:** Handle misspellings and partial names
- **Multi-criteria:** Search across names, organizations, positions, characteristics
- **Auto-complete:** Real-time suggestions with recent searches
- **Saved Searches:** Premium users can save complex search criteria

**Search Interface Design:**
```
Search Input Field:
├── Placeholder: "Search prospects, teams, positions..."
├── Auto-complete dropdown with categorized suggestions
├── Recent searches (authenticated users)
├── Advanced search toggle for complex criteria
└── Search result highlighting and relevance scoring

Advanced Search Options:
├── Position-specific filters
├── Statistical threshold settings
├── Geographic/organizational filters
├── ETA and age range sliders
└── ML prediction confidence ranges
```
