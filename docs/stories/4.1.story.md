# Story 4.1: Subscription Management System

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** prospect evaluation platform,
**I want** a robust subscription management system,
**so that** I can generate revenue through premium features while providing value to free users.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Stripe integration for payment processing with PCI compliance
2. Free tier limitations (top 100 prospects only, basic filtering, no export)
3. Premium tier features ($9.99/month): full top 500 rankings, advanced filtering, comparison tools, export functionality
4. Subscription lifecycle management (signup, billing, cancellation, reactivation)
5. Prorated billing and subscription changes handling
6. Payment failure handling with dunning management
7. GDPR-compliant subscription data handling and user deletion
8. Admin dashboard for subscription monitoring and customer support

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1-1.5: Complete user authentication system with JWT tokens (15-min access, 7-day refresh), Google OAuth integration, privacy policy acceptance tracking, User and UserSession models established. From Stories 3.1-3.5: Dynasty rankings system, prospect profiles, comparison tool, advanced search, and mobile optimization completed. Free tier users need restrictions on prospect access (top 100 only), export functionality, and comparison tools. Premium tier ($9.99/month) unlocks full top 500 rankings, advanced filtering, unlimited comparisons, and export features.

### Tech Stack
[Source: technical-architecture/1-system-overview.md#core-services]
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async/await patterns
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM (async)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe API with webhook integration
- **Caching**: Redis for subscription status caching (15-min TTL)
- **Email**: Email service (already established from Story 1.1) for dunning notifications

@router.get("/prospects")
async def get_prospects(
    limit: int = Query(100, le=100),  # Free tier max 100
    user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    subscription: Subscription = Depends(get_subscription_status)
):
    # If free tier, limit to top 100 prospects
    if subscription.plan_id == "free":
        limit = min(limit, 100)
    elif subscription.plan_id == "premium":
        limit = min(limit, 500)

    pass

@router.post("/prospects/export")
@subscription_tier_required("premium")
async def export_prospects(...):
    # Export functionality requires premium tier
    pass
```

### Stripe Integration

**Stripe Configuration:**
[Source: Epic 4.1 requirements + apps/api/app/core/config.py pattern]
```python
# Add to apps/api/app/core/config.py
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # Stripe Configuration
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: str = ""
    STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: str = ""
    STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: str = ""
    STRIPE_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID: str = ""  # Monthly price ID for premium plan ($9.99)
    STRIPE_SUCCESS_URL: str = "http://localhost:3000/subscription/success"
    STRIPE_CANCEL_URL: str = "http://localhost:3000/subscription/cancel"
```

**Stripe Products & Prices:**
- **Free Plan**: No Stripe subscription, default tier in User.subscription_tier
- **Premium Plan**: Stripe subscription with price_id (monthly billing at $9.99)

**Stripe Webhook Events to Handle:**
[Source: Epic 4.1 AC 1, 4, 5, 6]
- `customer.subscription.created` - New subscription activated
- `customer.subscription.updated` - Plan change, cancellation, or reactivation
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription fully terminated
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Successful billing
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Failed payment (trigger dunning)
- `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` - Trial ending reminder (if trials implemented)

**Webhook Signature Verification:**
```python
import stripe
from fastapi import Request, HTTPException

async def verify_stripe_webhook(request: Request, signature: str):
    """Verify Stripe webhook signature for security"""
    try:
        payload = await request.body()
        event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
            payload, signature, settings.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
        )
        return event
    except ValueError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid payload")
    except stripe.error.SignatureVerificationError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid signature")
```

### Service Patterns

**SubscriptionService Structure:**
[Source: Existing service pattern from apps/api/app/services/user_service.py]
```python
# apps/api/app/services/subscription_service.py
from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional
import stripe
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from app.db.models import User, Subscription
from app.core.config import settings

stripe.api_key = settings.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

class SubscriptionService:
    """Subscription management service following existing service patterns"""

    async def create_checkout_session(
        self, db: AsyncSession, user_id: int, plan_id: str
    ) -> dict:
        """Create Stripe checkout session for subscription"""
        # Get user, create Stripe customer if needed, create checkout session
        pass

    async def sync_subscription_from_stripe(
        self, db: AsyncSession, stripe_subscription_id: str
    ) -> Subscription:
        """Sync subscription data from Stripe to database"""
        # Fetch from Stripe API, update or create local subscription record
        pass

    async def cancel_subscription(
        self, db: AsyncSession, user_id: int, immediate: bool = False
    ) -> Subscription:
        """Cancel subscription (immediate or at period end)"""
        # Update Stripe subscription, update local record
        pass

    async def get_subscription_status(
        self, db: AsyncSession, user_id: int
    ) -> Optional[Subscription]:
        """Get current subscription status for user"""
        # Query subscription table with caching
        pass
```

**DunningService Structure:**
```python
# apps/api/app/services/dunning_service.py
class DunningService:
    """Payment failure handling and dunning management"""

    async def handle_payment_failed(
        self, db: AsyncSession, invoice: dict
    ) -> None:
        """Handle failed payment with retry logic"""
        # Update subscription status, send notification email, schedule retry
        pass

    async def retry_payment(
        self, db: AsyncSession, subscription_id: int
    ) -> bool:
        """Attempt payment retry"""
        # Stripe retry with exponential backoff
        pass

    async def apply_grace_period(
        self, db: AsyncSession, subscription_id: int
    ) -> None:
        """Apply 7-day grace period before feature restrictions"""
        # Update subscription status to past_due, schedule restriction
        pass
```

### Technical Constraints

**PCI Compliance:**
[Source: Epic 4.1 AC 1]
- **Payment Data**: NEVER store raw credit card data - use Stripe.js for client-side tokenization
- **Stripe Elements**: Use Stripe's hosted payment form to maintain PCI compliance
- **Webhook Security**: ALWAYS verify Stripe webhook signatures to prevent tampering
- **HTTPS Only**: All payment-related pages must use HTTPS in production

**Performance Requirements:**
[Source: technical-architecture/technical-constraints-considerations.md#performance-requirements]
- **Subscription Check**: <50ms for cached subscription status lookup (Redis 15-min TTL)
- **Checkout Session**: <1 second to create Stripe checkout session
- **Webhook Processing**: <500ms to process and save webhook events
- **Admin Dashboard**: <2 seconds to load subscription metrics

**Caching Strategy:**
[Source: technical-architecture/4-api-layer.md#api-response-caching]
```python
# Redis caching for subscription status
SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS_TTL = 900  # 15 minutes

async def get_subscription_status_cached(user_id: int) -> Optional[Subscription]:
    # Check Redis cache first
    cache_key = f"subscription:status:{user_id}"
    cached = await redis.get(cache_key)
    if cached:
        return Subscription.parse_raw(cached)

    # Fetch from database
    subscription = await get_subscription_from_db(user_id)

    # Cache result
    await redis.setex(cache_key, SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS_TTL, subscription.json())
    return subscription
```

**Error Handling:**
[Source: technical-architecture/technical-constraints-considerations.md#security-implementation]
- **Payment Failures**: Graceful degradation with clear user messaging
- **Webhook Failures**: Retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
- **Stripe API Errors**: Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/minute for free tier, 1000 requests/minute for premium tier

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
[Source: technical-architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- **Backend**: Pytest with async support for FastAPI endpoints
- **Frontend**: Jest + React Testing Library for component tests
- **Integration Tests**: Full subscription lifecycle testing (signup → billing → cancel → delete)
- **Webhook Tests**: Mock Stripe webhook events with test fixtures
- **GDPR Tests**: Verify complete data deletion and export functionality

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Subscription service methods: >90% coverage
- Webhook handlers: 100% coverage (critical for billing)
- Tier enforcement middleware: 100% coverage
- GDPR compliance flows: 100% coverage

**Stripe Test Mode:**
```python
# Use Stripe test mode for all development and testing
# Test card numbers:
# - Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
# - Decline: 4000 0000 0000 0002
# - Requires authentication: 4000 0025 0000 3155

# Stripe webhook testing with Stripe CLI:
# stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/webhooks/stripe
# stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-01

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The subscription management system implementation demonstrates functional completion of core features but has **critical security vulnerabilities and insufficient test coverage** that must be addressed before production deployment. The code exhibits 23 high-severity issues including webhook replay attack vulnerabilities, race conditions in subscription state management, and missing PCI compliance requirements.

**Overall Assessment**: FAIL - Critical security issues and inadequate test coverage (48% overall, 0% on admin endpoints)

### Test Coverage Analysis

**Overall Test Coverage: 48%** (Critical gaps in security, integration, and edge cases)

- Backend: 60% coverage with major gaps in webhook security, proration, and admin endpoints
- Frontend: 30% coverage with only 2 of 7+ components tested
- Integration Tests: 5% - Missing critical end-to-end workflows
- Security Tests: 20% - Webhook signature verification inadequate

### Critical Security Vulnerabilities Found

1. **Webhook Replay Attack Vulnerability** (webhooks.py:56-135) - No duplicate event ID checking
2. **Race Conditions** in subscription sync (subscription_service.py:106-199) - Missing transaction boundaries
3. **PCI Compliance Gap** - No audit trail for payment method changes
4. **Insecure Direct Object Reference** in subscription endpoints - Missing ownership verification
5. **Hardcoded JWT Secret** in config.py:50 - Security risk if .env not configured

### Refactoring Performed

Due to the critical nature of the security vulnerabilities, I recommend addressing these issues before any refactoring. The following refactoring opportunities were identified but NOT performed to avoid introducing instability:

- [ ] Extract duplicate user lookup code into reusable dependency
- [ ] Implement payment gateway abstraction for better testability
- [ ] Fix inefficient cache implementation that stores nothing
- [ ] Add proper timezone handling for datetime operations

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✗] Multiple violations including error handling, validation gaps
- Project Structure: [✓] Follows established patterns
- Testing Strategy: [✗] Insufficient coverage (48% vs 85% target), missing integration tests
- All ACs Met: [✗] AC5 (Proration) has 0% test coverage, AC8 (Admin) has 0% test coverage

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical - Must Fix Before Production:**
- [ ] Implement webhook replay attack prevention with event ID deduplication
- [ ] Add transaction boundaries and idempotency to subscription sync
- [ ] Implement proper webhook signature timestamp validation
- [ ] Add PCI-compliant audit logging for payment methods
- [ ] Create integration test suite for complete subscription lifecycle
- [ ] Add test coverage for proration calculations (AC5 - 0% coverage)
- [ ] Add test coverage for admin endpoints (AC8 - 0% coverage)
- [ ] Fix race conditions in concurrent webhook processing
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all Stripe error messages

**High Priority - Address Immediately:**
- [ ] Add database indexes for subscription_events queries
- [ ] Fix cache implementation that currently does nothing
- [ ] Implement input validation on plan_id and payment_method_id
- [ ] Add subscription state transition validation
- [ ] Handle all Stripe error types (RateLimitError, InvalidRequestError)
- [ ] Add GDPR data export/deletion for subscriptions
- [ ] Create Stripe webhook event fixtures for testing

**Medium Priority - Technical Debt:**
- [ ] Extract payment gateway abstraction layer
- [ ] Implement proper timezone handling
- [ ] Add health check endpoint for Stripe connection
- [ ] Implement webhook retry queue for failed processing
- [ ] Add comprehensive frontend component tests

### Security Review

**Critical Findings:**
- Webhook endpoints vulnerable to replay attacks and timing attacks
- Race conditions could corrupt subscription state during concurrent updates
- Missing PCI DSS audit trail requirements
- Hardcoded secrets in configuration with inadequate validation
- Error messages leak sensitive Stripe account information

**Recommendation:** DO NOT deploy to production without addressing critical security issues.

### Performance Considerations

- **N+1 Query Problem** in dunning service check_and_apply_restrictions (3 sequential queries)
- **Missing Indexes** on subscription_events(subscription_id, event_type) causing full table scans
- **Broken Cache** implementation returns nothing, forcing all requests to hit database
- **No Pagination** on invoice queries could cause memory issues with large datasets

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. Critical issues require team discussion before implementing fixes.

### Testing Gaps Summary

**Missing Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria:**
- **AC1 (Stripe/PCI)**: 60% gap - Missing security tests, webhook validation
- **AC2-3 (Tiers)**: 65% gap - Missing enforcement and edge cases
- **AC4 (Lifecycle)**: 50% gap - Missing integration tests
- **AC5 (Proration)**: 100% gap - NO TESTS AT ALL
- **AC6 (Dunning)**: 45% gap - Missing email and retry scheduling
- **AC7 (GDPR)**: 40% gap - Missing subscription cleanup
- **AC8 (Admin)**: 100% gap - NO TESTS AT ALL

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/4.1-subscription-management-system.yml
Risk Level: **CRITICAL** - Multiple security vulnerabilities and insufficient test coverage

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See critical items above]

**BLOCKING ISSUES:**
1. Webhook security vulnerabilities must be fixed
2. Test coverage must reach at least 70% (currently 48%)
3. All acceptance criteria must have test coverage (AC5 and AC8 have 0%)
4. Race conditions in subscription sync must be resolved
5. PCI compliance gaps must be addressed

The story cannot proceed to Done status until these critical issues are resolved. Recommend immediate security review and test coverage sprint.
