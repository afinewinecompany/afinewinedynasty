## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories to reference (first story in project).

### Data Models
**Core Database Schema from Architecture:**
[Source: technical-architecture/5-database-design.md#core-schema]
- **prospects table**: id, mlb_id, name, position, organization, level, age, eta_year, timestamps
- **prospect_stats table**: TimescaleDB hypertable for time-series performance data
- **users table**: email, password_hash, subscription_tier, stripe_customer_id, fantrax integration
- **user_sessions table**: JWT token management with UUID primary key

### API Specifications
[Source: technical-architecture/1-system-overview.md#core-services]
- **FastAPI 0.100+** with async capabilities required
- **JWT-based authentication** with 15-minute access tokens
- **Rate limiting**: 100 requests/minute baseline
- **Health endpoints** required for monitoring

### Component Specifications
[Source: technical-architecture/1-system-overview.md#frontend-service]
- **Next.js 14** with **React 18 + TypeScript**
- **Server-side rendering** for SEO optimization
- **Progressive Web App** capabilities
- **Mobile-first responsive design**

### File Locations
[Source: technical-architecture/6-deployment-strategy.md#infrastructure-overview]
- **Frontend**: `apps/web/` (Next.js application)
- **Backend API**: `apps/api/` (FastAPI service)
- **ML Service**: `apps/ml-pipeline/` (ML training/inference)
- **Docker configs**: `docker-compose.yml` at project root
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/` directory

### Testing Requirements
No specific testing strategy documentation found in architecture docs - will follow standard practices.

### Technical Constraints
[Source: technical-architecture/technical-constraints-considerations.md#performance-requirements]
- **Performance Targets**: <2s page loads, <500ms ML predictions, <1s search
- **Scalability**: Support 1000+ concurrent users, handle 100K+ daily API requests
- **Security**: TLS 1.3, AES-256 encryption, JWT tokens, rate limiting
- **Timeline**: 6-month MVP development (this is foundational month 1-2 work)

### Project Structure Notes
Current project has documentation structure but needs the core monorepo structure (apps/, packages/) to be created as defined in the architecture specifications.

### Testing

**Testing Standards:**
- Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library for components
- Backend: pytest for API testing
- Integration: docker-compose for full-stack testing
- CI/CD: Automated testing on all pull requests
