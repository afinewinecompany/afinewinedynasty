## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1: Historical data ingestion pipeline established with Apache Airflow, Fangraphs historical data scraping implemented with 1 req/sec rate limiting, scouting grade standardization to 20-80 scale, multi-source data mapping and integration logic. Data validation using Pydantic models and data freshness monitoring with alerting already exists.

From Story 2.3: ML inference service with Redis caching, authentication patterns, rate limiting infrastructure, and monitoring systems are established. All ML dependencies available in requirements.txt.

### Data Models
**Fangraphs Data Schema:**
[Source: technical-architecture/5-database-design.md#core-schema]
- **prospects table**: Basic prospect information (id, mlb_id, name, position, organization, level, age, eta_year)
- **scouting_grades table**: Multi-source scouting grades (20-80 scale) with source field for 'fangraphs'
- **prospect_stats hypertable**: Time-series performance data with hitting/pitching statistics

**Scouting Grades Integration:**
[Source: technical-architecture/5-database-design.md#scouting-grades]
```sql
CREATE TABLE scouting_grades (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    prospect_id INTEGER REFERENCES prospects(id),
    source VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'fangraphs', 'mlb_pipeline', etc.
    overall_grade INTEGER, -- 20-80 scale
    hit_grade INTEGER,
    power_grade INTEGER,
    speed_grade INTEGER,
    field_grade INTEGER,
    arm_grade INTEGER,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Data Freshness Tracking:**
[Source: Previous implementations from Story 2.1]
- Add `last_fangraphs_update` timestamp to prospects table
- Implement freshness monitoring for data quality assurance
- Track source attribution and update history

### API Specifications
**Fangraphs Data Collection:**
[Source: technical-architecture/2-data-pipeline.md#data-sources]
```python
# Fangraphs integration with rate limiting
class FangraphsService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter(calls=1, period=1)  # 1 req/sec

    async def get_prospect_data(self, prospect_name: str):
        async with self.rate_limiter:
            response = await self.session.get(
                f"https://www.fangraphs.com/prospects/{prospect_name}",
                headers={"User-Agent": "A Fine Wine Dynasty Bot"}
            )
            return self.parse_prospect_data(response)
```

**Data Pipeline Integration:**
[Source: technical-architecture/2-data-pipeline.md#daily-update-process]
```python
# Apache Airflow DAG integration
fangraphs_daily_task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='extract_fangraphs_data',
    python_callable=extract_fangraphs_data,
    dag=prospect_data_pipeline
)

# Task sequence: MLB data → Fangraphs data → validation → processing
extract_mlb_data >> extract_fangraphs_data >> validate_data >>
clean_data >> feature_engineering >> update_rankings
```
