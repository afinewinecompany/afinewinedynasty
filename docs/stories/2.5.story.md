## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3: ML inference service with SHAP explanation generation, Redis caching infrastructure, authentication patterns, and FastAPI application structure. Model serving infrastructure with error handling and fallback mechanisms established. Prediction caching strategy with Redis 24-hour TTL and cache invalidation on model updates already implemented.

From Story 2.4: Fangraphs data integration with comprehensive scouting grades, multi-source data mapping, and data freshness monitoring. Attribution requirements and legal compliance framework established for third-party data usage.

### Data Models
**ML Predictions Integration:**

- **ml_predictions table**: Contains feature_importance (JSONB for SHAP values), narrative (TEXT field for generated explanations), prospect_id, model_version, success_probability, confidence_level
- **prospects table**: Basic prospect information (id, mlb_id, name, position, organization, level, age, eta_year)
- **scouting_grades table**: Multi-source scouting grades (20-80 scale) for enriching narratives

**User Personalization Schema:**
[Source: technical-architecture/5-database-design.md#user-management]
- **users table**: Contains preferences (JSONB) field for league settings and team needs
- **user_sessions**: Authentication context for personalized requests

### API Specifications
**Narrative Generation Endpoints:**
[Source: technical-architecture/4-api-layer.md#ml-predictions]

async def get_prospect_outlook(
    prospect_id: int,
    user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    # Generate personalized AI outlook
    pass

@app.post("/api/ml/batch-outlook")
async def generate_batch_outlooks(
    prospect_ids: List[int],
    user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    # Batch outlook generation for rankings
    pass
```
