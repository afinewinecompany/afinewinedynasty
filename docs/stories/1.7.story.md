# Story 1.7: Monitoring, Observability & Analytics

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** platform operator,
**I want** comprehensive monitoring, error tracking, and analytics,
**so that** I can ensure platform health, track user behavior, and make data-driven improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Application performance monitoring (APM) with Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
2. Error tracking and alerting system with Sentry or similar service
3. User analytics tracking for feature usage and engagement (privacy-compliant)
4. Custom business metrics dashboard (active users, conversion rates, churn)
5. Log aggregation and search capability with structured logging
6. Health check endpoints for all services with detailed status reporting
7. User feedback collection mechanism integrated into the platform
8. Uptime monitoring and incident alerting system

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.0-1.5: Infrastructure exists but lacks observability. No current monitoring, analytics, or error tracking implemented. This story fills critical production readiness gaps.

### Monitoring Architecture
```
User Browser → Analytics
     ↓
Application → Prometheus → Grafana
     ↓           ↓
   Sentry    Logs (ELK/CloudWatch)
     ↓           ↓
  Alerts    Analysis
```

### Performance Targets
- Metric collection overhead: <1% CPU
- Log storage: 30-day retention minimum
- Alert response time: <1 minute for critical
- Dashboard load time: <3 seconds

### Privacy Considerations
- No PII in logs or metrics
- User IDs should be anonymized
- IP addresses should be hashed
- Comply with GDPR Article 25 (Privacy by Design)

### File Locations
- Metrics: `apps/api/app/metrics/`
- Logging config: `apps/api/app/core/logging.py`
- Health checks: `apps/api/app/api/health/`
- Frontend analytics: `apps/web/src/lib/analytics/`
- Dashboards: `infrastructure/monitoring/grafana/`

### Testing Requirements
- Test metric accuracy with load testing
- Verify error capture in staging
- Test alerting thresholds
- Validate privacy compliance

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Story 1.7 is focused on monitoring, observability, and analytics implementation. Currently in "Ready for Development" status with no implementation yet. This is a critical infrastructure story that addresses production readiness gaps identified from previous stories. The story is well-structured with comprehensive acceptance criteria covering APM, error tracking, analytics, and health monitoring.

### Story Type Analysis

- **Type**: Infrastructure / Observability Story
- **Implementation**: Not started (Status: Ready for Development)
- **Priority**: Critical for production readiness
- **Dependencies**: Requires external service setup (Story 1.0 extension)

### Compliance Check

- Story Structure: ✓ Well-organized with clear AC and task breakdown
- Architecture Design: ✓ Clear monitoring architecture documented
- Privacy Considerations: ✓ GDPR compliance and privacy-by-design noted
- Performance Targets: ✓ Specific metrics defined

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK AREAS:**
- No current monitoring or observability in place
- Production deployment without monitoring is dangerous
- Privacy compliance requirements for user analytics
- External service dependencies (Sentry, analytics services)

### Requirements Coverage Planning

Analyzing planned implementation coverage:

1. **AC1 (APM with Prometheus/Grafana)**: Comprehensive metrics planned
2. **AC2 (Error Tracking)**: Sentry integration with alerting rules
3. **AC3 (User Analytics)**: Privacy-compliant tracking planned
4. **AC4 (Business Metrics)**: Custom dashboards specified
5. **AC5 (Log Aggregation)**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
6. **AC6 (Health Checks)**: Detailed health endpoints planned
7. **AC7 (User Feedback)**: In-app feedback system specified
8. **AC8 (Uptime Monitoring)**: External monitoring with alerting

### Test Requirements Analysis

The story correctly identifies testing requirements:
- Metric accuracy validation with load testing
- Error capture verification in staging
- Alerting threshold testing
- Privacy compliance validation

### Security & Privacy Considerations

- ✓ No PII in logs or metrics requirement
- ✓ User ID anonymization planned
- ✓ IP address hashing specified
- ✓ GDPR Article 25 compliance noted
- ✓ DNT header respect planned
- ✓ Cookie consent implementation

### Technical Architecture Assessment

The monitoring architecture is well-designed:
```
User → Analytics → Application → Prometheus → Grafana
                        ↓             ↓
                    Sentry      Logs (ELK/CloudWatch)
                        ↓             ↓
                    Alerts       Analysis
```

### Performance Targets Review

- Metric collection overhead: <1% CPU ✓ Reasonable target
- Log retention: 30-day minimum ✓ Industry standard
- Alert response: <1 minute for critical ✓ Appropriate SLA
- Dashboard load: <3 seconds ✓ Good UX target

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Define specific alert escalation procedures
- [ ] Add capacity planning for metric storage
- [ ] Include cost estimation for monitoring services
- [ ] Add disaster recovery procedures for monitoring infrastructure
- [ ] Define SLIs/SLOs/SLAs for critical services
- [ ] Add synthetic monitoring for user journeys
- [ ] Include distributed tracing setup (OpenTelemetry)

### Dependencies Note

This story has a critical dependency on Story 1.0 extension (Task 0) where the user must set up external monitoring service accounts. This should be completed before development begins.

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.7-monitoring-observability-analytics.yml
Status Reason: Well-designed monitoring story ready for development. No code to review yet.

### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Development] - Can proceed once external service accounts are created
