## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1-1.4: FastAPI backend with async support, PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB, comprehensive database schema for prospects, prospect_stats, scouting_grades, and complete MLB Stats API integration with data ingestion pipeline. Authentication system with JWT tokens is established. All API endpoints for prospect data (/api/prospects, /api/prospects/{id}) are implemented and tested.

### Data Models
**Prospect Data Structure:**
[Source: technical-architecture/5-database-design.md#core-schema]
- **prospects table**: Available with fields id, mlb_id, name, position, organization, level, age, eta_year
- **prospect_stats**: TimescaleDB table with hitting stats (games_played, at_bats, hits, home_runs, rbi, batting_avg, on_base_pct, slugging_pct), pitching stats (innings_pitched, era, whip, strikeouts_per_nine), performance metrics (woba, wrc_plus)
- **ml_predictions**: Success probability, confidence level (High/Medium/Low), generated explanations

### API Specifications
**Frontend API Integration:**
[Source: technical-architecture/4-api-layer.md#prospect-data]
- **GET /api/prospects**: Paginated prospect rankings with query parameters for filtering (position, organization) and sorting
- **GET /api/prospects/{id}**: Individual prospect profile with related stats and scouting data
- **GET /api/prospects/search**: Fuzzy search prospects with auto-complete
- **Response Caching**: 1-hour TTL for prospect profiles, 30-minute TTL for rankings
- **Performance Target**: <100ms for database queries, <2 seconds for rankings page

### Component Specifications
**Frontend Architecture:**
[Source: technical-architecture/1-system-overview.md#core-services]
- **Next.js 14**: React 18 with TypeScript, server-side rendering for SEO
- **Progressive Web App**: Mobile-first responsive design capabilities
- **Real-time Updates**: Support for data refresh and live updates

**UI Design Requirements:**
[Source: ux-architecture/3-wireframe-specifications.md#prospect-rankings-dashboard]
- **Desktop Layout (1440px+)**: Filter panel (240px), main rankings table with sortable columns
- **Tablet (768-1024px)**: Filter panel collapses to dropdown, reduced columns
- **Mobile (320-767px)**: Card-based layout, bottom sheet filters, horizontal scroll for table
- **Interactive Elements**: ML prediction indicators (color-coded dots), sortable columns, hover actions

**Mobile-Specific Requirements:**
[Source: ux-architecture/5-mobile-optimization-strategy.md#mobile-content-strategy]
- **Card Design**: 140px height cards with prospect rank, name, ML prediction, performance stats
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for all interactive elements
- **Bottom Navigation**: 60px height with Home, Search, Compare, Watch, Profile tabs
- **Performance**: <2 seconds initial load, aggressive caching for mobile networks

### File Locations

### Project Structure Notes
Next.js 14 application is established in `apps/web` with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and basic authentication components. Backend API endpoints for prospect data are fully implemented and tested from Story 1.4. This story creates the frontend user interface to consume the existing API endpoints while following established mobile-first responsive design patterns.
