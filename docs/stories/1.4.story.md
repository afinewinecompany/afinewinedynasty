## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-25

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The MLB Stats API integration implementation demonstrates solid architecture with comprehensive error handling, rate limiting, and proper async patterns. The code follows Python best practices with appropriate exception handling, logging, and data validation through Pydantic schemas. Service-oriented architecture is well-implemented with clear separation of concerns across MLB API client, data ingestion, validation, duplicate detection, and scheduling services.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: apps/api/app/services/data_ingestion_service.py
- **Change**: Fixed incorrect field reference in ProspectStats model - changed `date` to `date_recorded` to match database schema
- **Why**: The service was using an incorrect field name that doesn't exist in the ProspectStats model
- **How**: Updated line 233 to use `date_recorded` field which matches the actual database schema
