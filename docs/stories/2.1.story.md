## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 1.1-1.5: Complete foundation infrastructure established with PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB, FastAPI backend, authentication system, and basic prospect data pipeline. Database schema for prospects, prospect_stats, scouting_grades, and ml_predictions tables is implemented. Current MLB API integration provides real-time data ingestion. This story builds the historical data processing foundation required for ML model training.

### Data Models
**Historical Data Schema:**
[Source: technical-architecture/5-database-design.md#core-schema]
- **prospects table**: Available with fields id, mlb_id, name, position, organization, level, age, eta_year
- **prospect_stats**: TimescaleDB hypertable partitioned by date_recorded with hitting stats (games_played, at_bats, hits, home_runs, rbi, batting_avg, on_base_pct, slugging_pct), pitching stats (innings_pitched, era, whip, strikeouts_per_nine), performance metrics (woba, wrc_plus)
- **scouting_grades**: Multi-source support with fields for source, overall_grade, hit_grade, power_grade, speed_grade, field_grade, arm_grade (20-80 scale)
- **ml_predictions**: Fields for success_probability, confidence_level, feature_importance (JSONB for SHAP values), narrative

**Feature Engineering Requirements:**
[Source: technical-architecture/3-ml-infrastructure.md#training-pipeline]
- **Age-adjusted performance metrics**: Standardized performance relative to age at each level
- **Level progression rates**: Advancement speed through minor league system

- **Target Variable**: Binary classification for MLB success (>500 PA or >100 IP within 4 years)

### Data Pipeline Architecture
**Historical Data Processing:**
[Source: technical-architecture/2-data-pipeline.md#historical-data-ingestion]
- **Apache Airflow**: DAG-based orchestration with daily scheduling
- **Data Sources**: MLB Stats API (1000 requests/day limit), Fangraphs (1 req/sec rate limiting)
- **Processing Flow**: External Sources → Raw Data Ingestion → Data Validation → Feature Engineering → ML Training Data
- **Data Quality**: Schema validation using Pydantic models, statistical outlier detection, cross-source consistency checks

**Pipeline Infrastructure:**
[Source: technical-architecture/2-data-pipeline.md#real-time-processing]
```python
# Apache Airflow DAG structure
prospect_data_pipeline = DAG(
    'prospect_data_ingestion',
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1)
)

# Task sequence
extract_mlb_data >> extract_fangraphs_data >> validate_data >>
clean_data >> feature_engineering >> update_rankings >> cache_results
```
