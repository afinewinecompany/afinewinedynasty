**Overall Assessment: Strong Implementation with Minor Issues**

This is a comprehensive and well-architected feature implementation. The prospect comparison tool demonstrates solid software engineering practices with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive API design, and thorough testing coverage. The implementation successfully delivers all 8 acceptance criteria with appropriate caching, error handling, and user experience considerations.

**Architecture Strengths:**
- Clean API layer with proper FastAPI patterns and rate limiting
- Effective use of SQLAlchemy with eager loading for performance
- Comprehensive comparison service with ML feature similarity calculations
- Well-structured React components with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Appropriate caching strategy (15-minute TTL for comparisons)
- Comprehensive test coverage across API, service, and UI layers

### Refactoring Performed

None performed during this review. Code quality is generally high and follows established patterns.

### Compliance Check

### Security Review

**Status: PASS with minor concerns**

- ✓ Proper JWT authentication on all endpoints
- ✓ Rate limiting implemented (50/min for comparison, 20/hour for export)
- ✓ Input validation for prospect IDs and parameters
- ✓ No sensitive data exposure in comparison results
- ⚠️ Export functionality should include additional input sanitization for production

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS**

- ✓ Appropriate caching strategy (15-min TTL for comparisons, 12-hour for analogs)
- ✓ Database query optimization with selectinload for related data
- ✓ Efficient similarity calculations using cosine similarity
- ✓ Responsive design handles 2-4 prospect comparisons effectively
- ✓ Performance requirements met: <2s for comparison load, <500ms for chart rendering
