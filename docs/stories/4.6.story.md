- **Tablet (768-1024px)**: Stacked layouts with collapsible sections
- **Mobile (320-767px)**: Card-based layouts with bottom sheet filters

**Component Patterns:**
- Card-based layouts using shadcn/ui Card component
- Badge components for severity, confidence, value indicators
- Collapsible sections for detailed breakdowns
- Loading states with Loader2 spinner from lucide-react
- Error states with Alert component from shadcn/ui
- Empty states with descriptive messaging and call-to-action

- **Warning/Risk**: Orange (bg-orange-50, text-orange-600)
- **Error/Critical**: Red (bg-red-50, text-red-600)

### State Management Strategy

**Component State Pattern:**
```typescript
// Use existing useFantrax pattern as reference
const {
  data,
  loading,
  error,
  refetch
} = useRecommendations();
```

**Loading States:**
- Display Loader2 spinner with descriptive text
- Disable interactive elements during loading
- Show skeleton loaders for content (optional enhancement)

**Error Handling:**
- Display user-friendly error messages in Alert components
- Provide retry functionality with refetch
- Handle 403 (premium tier) errors with upgrade prompt
- Handle 429 (rate limit) errors with retry guidance

**Empty States:**
- Show descriptive messaging when no data available
- Provide actionable next steps (e.g., "Sync roster", "Select league")
- Use appropriate icons from lucide-react

### Integration Points

**Existing Components:**
[Source: apps/web/src/components/recommendations/PersonalizedRecommendations.tsx]
- PersonalizedRecommendations component shows basic pattern for:
  - useFantrax hook integration
  - Loading/error/empty state handling
  - Card-based layout with badges
  - Mobile-responsive grid layouts
  - Color-coded fit scores

**Existing Hooks:**
[Source: apps/web/src/hooks/useFantrax.ts - inferred from usage]
- useFantrax provides: selectedLeague, loading states, error handling
- Pattern for data fetching with React hooks
- State management for API responses

**shadcn/ui Components Available:**
- Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent
- Button (variants: default, outline, destructive)
- Badge (variants: default, outline, destructive)
- Alert, AlertDescription
- Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue
- Slider for range inputs
- Checkbox for multi-select

### Authentication & Authorization

**Premium Tier Requirements:**
[Source: Story 4.4 Security Considerations]
- All recommendation endpoints require premium tier authorization
- Display upgrade prompt for 403 Forbidden responses
- Show premium badge or indicator on components
- Handle JWT token expiration gracefully

**Rate Limiting:**
[Source: Story 4.4 QA Results]
- 60 requests/hour limit on recommendation endpoints
- Display rate limit error with retry guidance
- Implement client-side request throttling (optional enhancement)

### Performance Considerations

**Response Time Targets:**
[Source: Story 4.4 Performance Requirements]
- Team needs analysis: <2 seconds
- Prospect recommendations: <3 seconds
- Trade targets: <4 seconds
- Draft strategy: <3 seconds

**Caching Strategy:**
[Source: Story 4.4 Caching Strategy]
- Backend caching handles most optimization
- Client-side: Cache responses in hook state
- Refetch on user action (refresh button, filter change)
- Respect backend TTLs (30-min recommendations, 1-hour team needs)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: technical-architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

**Test File Locations:**
- Component tests: `apps/web/src/__tests__/recommendations/*.test.tsx`

 */
describe('TeamNeedsOverview Component', () => {
  it('should display team needs when data is loaded', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should show loading state while fetching', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle error state gracefully', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should be mobile responsive', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: Good with Concerns**

The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality with comprehensive TypeScript type definitions, well-documented components using JSDoc comments, and consistent architectural patterns. All 7 UI components are production-ready with proper error handling, loading states, and mobile-responsive designs. The useRecommendations hook provides clean state management, and the API client integration follows established patterns.

However, **test coverage is incomplete** with only 4 of 9 required test files implemented (44% coverage). This creates significant risk for regressions and prevents full validation of acceptance criteria.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with 15+ interfaces matching backend schemas
- Excellent component documentation with @component, @param, @returns, @example tags
- Consistent use of shadcn/ui patterns and Tailwind CSS
- Proper separation of concerns (components, hooks, API client, types)
- Well-implemented loading, error, and empty states across all components
- Mobile-responsive designs with proper breakpoint handling
- Clean state management with granular loading/error states per operation

**Concerns:**
- Missing 5 of 9 required test files (DraftStrategyBoard, StashCandidates, RiskToleranceSettings, RecommendationFilters, API client)
- Incomplete test coverage prevents validation of AC 10

### Refactoring Performed

### Improvements Checklist

**Test Coverage Gaps (Must Address):**
- [ ] Create DraftStrategyBoard.test.tsx with tier display, pick number input, and BPA guidance tests
- [ ] Create StashCandidates.test.tsx with roster spots logic, upside display, and candidate rendering tests
- [ ] Create RiskToleranceSettings.test.tsx with preference updates, form validation, save/reset tests
- [ ] Create RecommendationFilters.test.tsx with filter state management, multi-select behavior, reset tests
- [ ] Create apps/web/src/__tests__/api/recommendations.test.ts to test all 7 API client functions as specified in Task 10

**Future Enhancements (Optional):**
- [ ] Add integration tests that test components with real API responses
- [ ] Enhance accessibility tests for screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation beyond basic requirements
- [ ] Add visual regression tests for mobile-responsive layout validation
- [ ] Consider adding skeleton loaders for improved perceived performance during loading states

### Security Review

**Status: PASS**

- No sensitive data handling in UI components (all data comes from backend API)
- Premium tier authorization properly delegated to backend endpoints
- No XSS vulnerabilities detected (React automatically escapes output)
- No localStorage/sessionStorage usage for sensitive data
- JWT tokens handled by existing API client infrastructure
- Component props validated through TypeScript interfaces

**Recommendations:**
- None required for this story scope

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS**

All components follow React performance best practices:

- **Memoization**: useCallback used appropriately in useRecommendations hook for fetch functions
- **Loading States**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders with granular loading flags
- **Caching**: API client implements TTL-based caching (30-60 minutes) as designed in Story 4.4
- **Bundle Size**: Components import only needed icons from lucide-react (tree-shakeable)
- **Rendering**: No detected n² loops or expensive computations in render methods

**Performance Characteristics:**
- TeamNeedsOverview: Efficiently renders depth analysis maps with Object.entries
- RecommendationCard: Expandable sections prevent rendering all details upfront
- TradeTargetsList: Category filtering updates without full re-fetch
- DraftStrategyBoard: Pick number debouncing via controlled input prevents excessive API calls
- All components use proper React keys for list rendering

### Testability Assessment

**Controllability**: ✓ Good
- Components accept all required props for different states
- autoLoad prop allows controlled testing
- Mock-friendly hook architecture

**Observability**: ✓ Good
- Clear loading/error/success states
- Callback props (onClick, onRefresh) enable parent observation
- Components render semantic HTML for test queries

**Debuggability**: ✓ Excellent
- Comprehensive prop documentation
- TypeScript prevents common bugs
- Clear error messages from API client

### Files Modified During Review

None - no refactoring required

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → [docs/qa/gates/4.6-recommendation-dashboard-ui-components.yml](docs/qa/gates/4.6-recommendation-dashboard-ui-components.yml)

**Reason**: Missing 5 of 9 required test files (56% test coverage gap). While all implemented components are high quality and functionally complete, incomplete test coverage prevents validation of AC 10 and creates regression risk.

**Quality Score**: 50/100
- Deduction: 10 points per missing high-severity test file (5 files × 10 = 50 points)

**Must Fix Before Production:**
1. Create DraftStrategyBoard.test.tsx
2. Create StashCandidates.test.tsx
3. Create RiskToleranceSettings.test.tsx
4. Create RecommendationFilters.test.tsx
5. Create API client tests (recommendations.test.ts)

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Complete Test Coverage**

Before marking story as Done:
1. Add 5 missing test files listed above
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Request re-review to validate AC 10 completion

**Note**: The implementation quality is excellent. Once tests are added, this story will easily achieve PASS gate status.
