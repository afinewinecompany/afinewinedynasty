### Database Design

**Existing User Schema**
[Source: technical-architecture/5-database-design.md]
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255),
    subscription_tier VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'free',
    stripe_customer_id VARCHAR(50),
    fantrax_user_id VARCHAR(50),
    fantrax_refresh_token TEXT,
    preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_login TIMESTAMP
);
```

**New Tables Required for Story 4.5:**
- `watchlists` - Track user prospect watchlists with notes
- `email_preferences` - Manage digest settings and frequency
- `achievements` - Define available achievements
- `user_achievements` - Track unlocked achievements per user
- `referral_codes` - Store referral codes and usage tracking
- `referrals` - Track referral relationships and rewards
- `feedback` - Store user feedback and ratings
- `analytics_events` - Capture user interaction events
- `user_engagement_metrics` - Aggregate engagement data for churn prediction

**Indexing Strategy**
[Source: technical-architecture/5-database-design.md]
- Create indexes on user_id for all new user-relationship tables
- Add composite indexes for frequent queries (user_id + timestamp)
- Use JSONB indexes for analytics_events event_data queries

### API Layer

**Existing API Pattern**
[Source: technical-architecture/4-api-layer.md]
- Authentication endpoints: `/api/auth/*`
- User profile: `/api/users/profile`
- Caching strategy: Redis with TTL-based invalidation

**New Endpoints Required:**
- `POST /api/users/onboarding/complete` - Mark onboarding complete
- `GET/POST/DELETE /api/watchlist` - Watchlist CRUD operations
- `GET/PUT /api/users/email-preferences` - Email digest settings
- `GET /api/achievements` - List all achievements
- `GET /api/users/achievements` - User's unlocked achievements
- `POST /api/referrals/generate` - Generate referral code
- `GET /api/referrals/stats` - Referral statistics
- `POST /api/feedback` - Submit user feedback
- `POST /api/analytics/track` - Track analytics events
- `GET /api/users/engagement` - Get user engagement metrics

**API Caching Strategy**
[Source: technical-architecture/4-api-layer.md]
- Watchlist changes: No cache, real-time data
- Achievements: 1-hour TTL, invalidate on unlock
- Analytics: No cache for event submission
- Engagement metrics: 15-minute TTL for dashboards

### UX Design Context

**User Onboarding Flow**
[Source: ux-architecture/1-user-journey-flows.md#Flow-1]
```
Onboarding Sequence:
├── Welcome & Platform Overview
├── Feature Tour (Rankings, Profiles, Comparisons)
├── Subscription Tier Selection
└── Optional: Fantrax Integration Setup
```

**Success Metrics**
[Source: ux-architecture/8-success-metrics-validation.md]
- Time to first prospect evaluation: <3 minutes from registration
- User retention: >95% week-1, >80% month-1, >60% month-6
- Feature adoption: 70% use comparison tool within first week

**Behavioral Milestones**
[Source: ux-architecture/1-user-journey-flows.md#1.3]
- Day 1: Complete registration, view top 25 prospects
- Day 3: Use filtering and individual prospect profiles
- Week 1: Complete first prospect comparison
- Week 2: Establish regular research pattern (2-3 sessions)
- Month 1: Consider premium upgrade or integrate Fantrax

### Previous Story Context

**Story 4.2 Implementation Notes**
- Feature flag system implemented with tier-based access control
- Beta features use `beta_features_enabled` in user preferences
- User preferences stored in JSONB field on users table
- Frontend components use subscription tier checks for feature gating

**Story 4.4 Implementation Notes**
- User preference model includes risk tolerance settings
- Recommendation system uses stored preferences for personalization
- API endpoints follow pattern: `/api/recommendations/{category}/{league_id}`

### Email Provider Selection

**No specific guidance found in architecture docs**

For Story 4.5, the team will need to select an email service provider. Common options:
- **Resend** - Developer-friendly, simple API
- **SendGrid** - Enterprise-grade, proven reliability
- **AWS SES** - Cost-effective if already using AWS

This decision should be made during implementation based on:
- Cost per email for expected volume
- Deliverability rates
- API simplicity and documentation
- Integration with existing infrastructure

### Analytics Privacy Considerations

**Security Implementation**
[Source: technical-architecture/technical-constraints-considerations.md]
- GDPR compliance required for user data
- User data export/deletion endpoints needed
- Encryption at rest: AES-256 for sensitive data
- TLS 1.3 for all communications

**Analytics Implementation Notes:**
- Obtain user consent for analytics tracking
- Allow users to opt-out of non-essential tracking
- Anonymize analytics data where possible
- Provide transparency about data collection in privacy policy
- Implement data retention policies for analytics events

### Background Jobs and Scheduling

**No specific guidance found in architecture docs**

For weekly email digests and analytics aggregation, the team will need:
- Background task queue (e.g., Celery with Redis, APScheduler, or FastAPI Background Tasks)
- Scheduled job system for recurring tasks
- Job monitoring and failure handling

Implementation approach should:
- Use lightweight solution appropriate for solo developer timeline
- Ensure jobs can be monitored and debugged
- Handle failures gracefully with retry logic
- Support timezone-aware scheduling for user-specific send times

### Technical Debt Identification

**Immediate Debt (Story 4.5):**
1. **Missing Tests for Watchlist Service** (High Priority)
   - Debt: No tests for WatchlistService CRUD operations
   - Impact: Risk of regressions when modifying watchlist logic
   - Effort: ~2 hours to create comprehensive test suite
   - Recommendation: Must fix before marking story "Done"

2. **Missing Integration Tests** (High Priority)
   - Debt: No API-level tests for onboarding or watchlist endpoints
   - Impact: Cannot verify end-to-end request/response flow
   - Effort: ~3 hours for both endpoint test suites
   - Recommendation: Must fix before marking story "Done"

3. **Incomplete Story Scope** (Medium Priority)
   - Debt: Only 2 of 8 ACs fully implemented
   - Impact: Users cannot benefit from full engagement feature set
   - Effort: ~40-60 hours to complete remaining 6 features
   - Recommendation: Split into separate stories for Tasks 3-8

**Architectural Debt:**
1. **Email Provider Not Selected** (Medium Priority)
   - Debt: Task 3 (email digest) blocked until provider chosen
   - Impact: Cannot implement weekly digest system
   - Effort: 2-4 hours for evaluation + integration
   - Recommendation: Team decision needed on Resend vs SendGrid vs AWS SES

2. **Background Job System Not Defined** (Medium Priority)
   - Debt: No task queue for email digests, analytics aggregation
   - Impact: Tasks 3, 7, 8 cannot be fully implemented
   - Effort: 4-8 hours to integrate Celery or APScheduler
   - Recommendation: Architectural decision needed

**Pre-existing Debt (Not Blocking):**
- 87 `any` type usages across frontend codebase
- Prettier formatting violations in multiple files
- Unused imports in discovery components
- Note: These are from prior stories and not in scope for Story 4.5 review

### Files Modified During Review

- apps/web/src/hooks/useWatchlist.ts (enhanced documentation)

**Note to Dev:** Please add the above file to the File List in the Dev Agent Record section.

### Gate Status

**Gate**: CONCERNS → [docs/qa/gates/4.5-user-engagement-retention-features.yml](../qa/gates/4.5-user-engagement-retention-features.yml)

**Risk profile**: Not generated (story partially complete, risk assessment deferred)

**NFR assessment**: Inline (see Security Review and Performance Considerations sections above)

### Recommended Status

**⚠ Changes Required - See unchecked items in Improvements Checklist**

**Rationale:**
While the implemented portions of Story 4.5 (Tasks 1-2) demonstrate excellent code quality, the story cannot be marked "Done" due to:
1. Critical test coverage gaps for watchlist service
2. Missing integration tests for API endpoints
3. Scope partially completed (2 of 8 ACs fully done)

**Recommendation:**
- **Option A (Recommended)**: Split story
  - Mark current work as "Story 4.5.1: Onboarding & Watchlist" and move to Done after adding missing tests
  - Create "Story 4.5.2: Engagement Features" for Tasks 3-8

- **Option B**: Add missing tests and mark Tasks 1-2 as complete, acknowledge Tasks 3-8 as future work in story notes

Story owner decides final approach based on sprint goals and priorities.
