    user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    # Load cached model
    model = await get_cached_model()

    # Get prospect features
    features = await get_prospect_features(prospect_id)

    # Generate prediction with SHAP explanation
    prediction = model.predict_proba([features])[0][1]
    shap_values = await generate_shap_explanation(model, features)

    # Determine confidence level
    confidence = determine_confidence_level(prediction, shap_values)
