## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 2.1-2.5: Complete ML prediction infrastructure with SHAP explanations, Redis caching (24-hour TTL for predictions), FastAPI application structure, prospect data pipeline, and AI narrative generation. Database schema includes prospects, prospect_stats (TimescaleDB), ml_predictions, and scouting_grades tables. Authentication and subscription management systems established.

### Data Models
**Core Prospect Rankings Schema:**
[Source: technical-architecture/5-database-design.md#core-schema]
- **prospects table**: id, mlb_id, name, position, organization, level, age, eta_year with indexes on organization, position, eta_year
- **prospect_stats table**: TimescaleDB hypertable with batting/pitching statistics, performance metrics (woba, wrc_plus) partitioned by date_recorded
- **ml_predictions table**: success_probability, confidence_level (High/Medium/Low), feature_importance (JSONB), narrative with composite index on (prospect_id, generated_at DESC)
- **scouting_grades table**: Multi-source scouting data (20-80 scale) with source attribution and updated_at timestamps

**User Management Integration:**
[Source: technical-architecture/5-database-design.md#user-management]
- **users table**: subscription_tier for export access validation, preferences (JSONB) for personalized settings
- **user_sessions table**: JWT authentication context for API access

### API Specifications

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Comprehensive implementation with strong architecture and design patterns. The dynasty ranking algorithm is well-structured with proper component weighting. All major acceptance criteria are met with quality implementations. Frontend follows React best practices with proper state management and responsive design.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/api/app/api/api_v1/endpoints/prospects.py
  - **Change**: Fixed single prospect endpoint ranking calculation bug
  - **Why**: Endpoint was returning rank=0 instead of calculating actual position
  - **How**: Added percentile-based ranking estimation for individual prospect lookups

- **File**: apps/api/app/services/dynasty_ranking_service.py
  - **Change**: Enhanced null safety and performance score calculation bounds
  - **Why**: Prevent division by zero errors and ensure score components stay within expected ranges
  - **How**: Added proper null checks and min/max bounds to all stat calculations

- **File**: apps/api/app/services/export_service.py
  - **Change**: Improved CSV formatting error handling
  - **Why**: Prevent formatting errors when stat values are None
  - **How**: Updated null checks to use `is not None` instead of truthy evaluation

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Python/TypeScript best practices, proper typing, error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows established patterns, proper separation of concerns
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests for services, component tests for UI, mocked integrations
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
