## Core Narrative & Positioning

### The Story
"From 8 hours of manual prospect research → 1 hour with ML-powered insights. Built by a dynasty player who was tired of scattered data and unreliable rankings."

### Unique Value Proposition
- **Problem:** Dynasty players spend 5+ hours/week manually cross-referencing fragmented data sources (Fangraphs, MLB Pipeline, Statcast)
- **Solution:** ML-powered prospect rankings based on 15+ years of historical data with 65%+ prediction accuracy (vs 45% industry baseline)
- **Result:** Under 1 hour/week for superior prospect evaluation decisions

### Target Audience
- Active dynasty fantasy baseball league participants
- Serious fantasy players willing to pay for competitive edge
- Data-savvy baseball fans who appreciate analytical depth
- Fantrax users seeking integrated roster management

**Visual Assets Needed:**

## Sample Pre-Launch Tweet Series

### Week 1: Problem Introduction
```
Real talk: How confident are you in your dynasty prospect evaluations?

Most of us are flying blind - jumping between 4 different sites, manually
cross-referencing scouting grades, guessing at MLB timelines.

There's a better way. Building it now. 🧵

[Thread continues with 4-5 more tweets detailing the pain points]
```

### Week 2: Solution Tease
```
What if you could see:
• ML-powered prospect predictions (65% accuracy vs 45% industry avg)
• Historical player comparisons (actual outcomes, not guesses)
• Personalized dynasty recommendations (based on YOUR roster)

All in one place. In under 1 hour/week.

A Fine Wine Dynasty - launching [DATE].

### Week 3: Technical Credibility

Just hit a milestone: Our ML model correctly predicted 67% of prospect
outcomes in our test set.
