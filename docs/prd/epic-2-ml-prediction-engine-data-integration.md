# Epic 2: ML Prediction Engine & Data Integration

**Goal:** Build machine learning pipeline with historical data processing, model training, and real-time prediction generation with confidence scoring. This epic creates the core differentiator that sets A Fine Wine Dynasty apart from existing prospect evaluation tools through predictive analytics.

## Story 2.1: Historical Data Collection and Processing
As a system,
I need comprehensive historical minor league data for model training,
so that ML predictions can be based on proven patterns of prospect development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Historical data ingestion pipeline for 15+ years of MiLB â†’ MLB transitions (~50,000 prospect records)
2. Data cleaning and normalization for consistent feature engineering across different seasons
3. Feature extraction for age-adjusted performance metrics and level progression rates
4. Data validation and quality checks for missing or inconsistent records
5. Historical scouting grade integration from multiple sources with standardization to 20-80 scale
6. Target variable creation (binary classification: MLB success defined as >500 PA or >100 IP within 4 years)
7. Train/validation/test data splitting with proper temporal separation to prevent data leakage
8. Data versioning and lineage tracking for model reproducibility

## Story 2.2: ML Model Training Pipeline
As a data scientist,
I want an automated model training pipeline with proper validation,
so that prospect predictions are accurate and continuously improving.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Feature engineering pipeline with age adjustments, rate statistics, and level progression metrics
2. Gradient Boosting model implementation (XGBoost/LightGBM) with hyperparameter tuning
3. Cross-validation strategy respecting temporal ordering of training data
4. Model evaluation metrics tracking (precision, recall, AUC) with target 65%+ accuracy
5. Feature importance analysis using SHAP for model interpretability
6. Model versioning and artifact storage for deployment and rollback capabilities
7. Automated model retraining schedule (weekly during active seasons)
8. A/B testing framework for comparing model versions

## Story 2.3: ML Inference Service
As a user,
I want real-time prospect predictions with confidence scoring,
so that I can make informed decisions about prospect evaluation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. FastAPI-based ML inference service with horizontal scaling capabilities
2. Real-time prediction generation for individual prospects with <500ms response time
3. Confidence scoring algorithm producing High/Medium/Low classifications
4. SHAP explanation generation for individual predictions
5. Batch prediction capability for ranking updates across all prospects
6. Model serving infrastructure with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
7. Prediction caching strategy with Redis to optimize performance
8. API endpoints for both individual and batch prediction requests

## Story 2.4: Fangraphs Data Integration
As a system,
I need reliable access to Fangraphs prospect data and scouting grades,
so that predictions are based on comprehensive, up-to-date information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Fangraphs data integration with proper rate limiting (1 req/sec) and error handling
2. Daily scraping/API ingestion of prospect statistics and scouting grades
3. Data mapping and standardization to internal prospect data schema
4. Duplicate detection and conflict resolution for overlapping data sources
5. Data freshness monitoring and alerting for ingestion failures
6. Backup data source strategy in case of Fangraphs access issues
7. Legal compliance verification for data usage and attribution
8. Cost monitoring and optimization for data acquisition

## Story 2.5: AI Player Outlook Generation
As a dynasty fantasy player,
I want AI-generated explanations for each prospect's rating,
so that I understand the reasoning behind predictions and can make informed decisions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Jinja2 template engine for dynamic narrative generation based on SHAP feature importance
2. 3-4 sentence player outlook covering top contributing factors, risk assessment, and timeline
3. Content structure templates for different prospect archetypes (hitters vs pitchers, age groups)
4. Personalization capability based on user's league settings and team needs
5. Redis caching for generated explanations with cache invalidation on data updates
6. Natural language quality assurance to ensure readable, coherent explanations
7. A/B testing framework for different explanation formats and effectiveness
8. Integration with prospect profile pages and ranking displays
