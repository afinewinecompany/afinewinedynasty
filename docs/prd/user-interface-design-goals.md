# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Clean, data-driven interface optimized for quick decision-making by fantasy baseball experts. The design should feel professional and analytical (like financial trading platforms) while remaining accessible on mobile devices. Primary focus on information density without overwhelming casual users, with clear visual hierarchy emphasizing prospect rankings and key decision factors.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Dashboard-first approach**: Prospect rankings as primary landing page with powerful filtering
- **Quick comparison workflows**: Side-by-side prospect analysis with key metrics highlighted
- **Progressive disclosure**: Basic rankings visible to all, detailed analytics for premium users
- **Mobile-responsive gestures**: Swipe for prospect comparisons, pull-to-refresh for rankings updates
- **Search-driven discovery**: Fuzzy search for prospect names with auto-complete

## Core Screens and Views
- **Prospect Rankings Dashboard**: Filterable top 500 list with key metrics columns
- **Individual Prospect Profile**: Detailed stats, scouting grades, ML prediction, and historical comparisons
- **Comparison Tool**: Side-by-side analysis of multiple prospects
- **User Account/Subscription Management**: Registration, billing, Fantrax integration setup
- **Mobile Prospect Quick View**: Streamlined mobile interface for on-the-go decisions

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Targeting WCAG AA compliance for broader user accessibility, ensuring color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility for prospect data tables and charts.

## Branding
Professional sports analytics aesthetic with baseball-inspired design elements. Color palette emphasizing data visualization best practices (avoiding red/green for colorblind users), with clean typography prioritizing readability of numerical data and statistics.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Mobile-first responsive web application optimizing for both desktop research sessions (detailed analysis) and mobile quick-reference usage (checking rankings, prospect updates). Native mobile apps deferred to Phase 2 based on user feedback and engagement patterns.
