## Background Context

Dynasty fantasy baseball players face critical information asymmetry when evaluating minor league prospects. Current prospect evaluation requires manually synthesizing data from multiple sources (Fangraphs, MLB Pipeline, Statcast), interpreting inconsistent scouting grades, and attempting to predict major league success without historical context or predictive modeling. This creates analysis paralysis where competitive players spend 3-8 hours weekly researching prospects manually across fragmented platforms.

A Fine Wine Dynasty solves this through a machine learning-powered prospect evaluation engine that combines 15+ years of historical minor league â†’ major league transition data with real-time performance statistics and scouting grades. The platform transforms scattered, hard-to-interpret prospect data into actionable dynasty-specific rankings, enabling competitive dynasty players to maintain strategic advantages while dramatically reducing research time investment.
