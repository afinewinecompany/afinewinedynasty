- **Readiness for architecture phase**: Ready with minor clarifications needed
- **Most critical gap**: Explicit user journey documentation and data migration strategy

## Category Analysis Table

| Category                         | Status  | Critical Issues |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context  | PASS    | None |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition          | PASS    | Minor - could better articulate learning goals |
| 3. User Experience Requirements  | PARTIAL | Missing explicit user journey flows |
| 4. Functional Requirements       | PASS    | None |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements   | PASS    | None |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure        | PASS    | None |
| 7. Technical Guidance            | PASS    | None |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | PARTIAL | Data migration strategy needs clarification |
| 9. Clarity & Communication       | PASS    | None |

## Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH Priority:**
- User journey flows not explicitly documented (implied in stories but not visualized)
- Historical data migration strategy needs more detail for 15+ years of prospect data

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- MVP learning goals could be more specific beyond user acquisition metrics
- Error handling patterns not consistently detailed across all stories
- Integration testing approach needs more specificity

**LOW Priority:**
- Could benefit from wireframes or UI mockups reference
- Monitoring and alerting requirements could be more granular

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Analysis**: The MVP scope is appropriately sized for 6-month development timeline with solo founder. Each epic delivers meaningful value while building logically toward complete platform.

**Potential Scope Reductions** (if needed):
- AI Player Outlook Generation (Story 2.5) - could defer to Phase 2
- Advanced Search and Discovery (Story 3.4) - could simplify to basic search only
- User Engagement and Retention Features (Story 4.5) - could defer non-essential engagement features

**Essential Features Confirmed**:
- ML prediction engine (core differentiator)
- Fantrax integration (critical for target users)
- Real-time prospect rankings (primary value proposition)
- Subscription system (monetization requirement)

## Technical Readiness

**Technical Constraints**: Clearly defined with comprehensive technology stack decisions based on Project Brief specifications.

**Identified Technical Risks**:
- Fangraphs data access reliability and legal compliance
- ML model accuracy achieving 65% target with available data
- Fantrax API integration complexity and rate limiting

**Areas for Architect Investigation**:
- Historical data pipeline architecture for 50K+ prospect records
- ML model serving infrastructure with <500ms response times
- Real-time ranking update architecture

## Recommendations

**Before Architecture Phase**:
1. Document primary user journey flows (registration → rankings → prospect analysis → decision)
2. Clarify historical data migration strategy and timeline
3. Define specific MVP learning goals and success criteria

**During Architecture Phase**:
1. Deep dive on ML pipeline architecture for scale and performance
2. Design data ingestion architecture with proper error handling and recovery
3. Plan integration testing strategy for Fantrax and Fangraphs APIs

**Quality Improvements**:
1. Add wireframe references to UI design goals section
2. Expand monitoring requirements for each service component
3. Define specific error handling patterns for user-facing features
