# Security Development Checklist

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Implementation
- [ ] JWT tokens use strong, configurable secret keys
- [ ] Access tokens have appropriate expiration times (15 minutes)
- [ ] Refresh tokens have longer expiration (7 days)
- [ ] Token validation includes signature and expiration checks
- [ ] Invalid tokens are properly rejected

### Password Security
- [ ] Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt
- [ ] Password complexity requirements are enforced
- [ ] Minimum 8 characters, maximum 128 characters
- [ ] Must contain: uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character
- [ ] Plain text passwords are never stored or logged

### User Authentication
- [ ] Generic error messages prevent user enumeration
- [ ] Failed login attempts don't reveal if user exists
- [ ] Credential verification uses secure comparison
- [ ] Account lockout is considered for repeated failures

## Rate Limiting & DoS Protection

### Rate Limiting Implementation
- [ ] Authentication endpoints: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- [ ] Sensitive endpoints: 3 attempts per 1 hour
- [ ] Rate limits are enforced per IP address
- [ ] Rate limiting uses Redis for distributed systems
- [ ] Rate limit exceeded responses are consistent

### Request Protection
- [ ] Request size is limited (2MB maximum)
- [ ] Request timeout is configured appropriately
- [ ] Concurrent request limits are in place
- [ ] Large file uploads are handled securely

## Input Validation & Sanitization

### Email Validation
- [ ] Email format validation is RFC-compliant
- [ ] Email addresses are converted to lowercase
- [ ] XSS patterns in emails are detected and rejected
- [ ] Email length limits are enforced

### Input Sanitization
- [ ] All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] SQL injection patterns are prevented
- [ ] XSS payloads are detected and blocked
- [ ] Null bytes are removed from inputs
- [ ] Control characters are filtered out

### Data Validation
- [ ] Required fields are validated on server side
- [ ] Field length limits are enforced
- [ ] Data types are strictly validated
- [ ] Unexpected fields are handled appropriately

## Security Headers & CORS

### HTTP Security Headers
- [ ] `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` is set
- [ ] `X-Frame-Options: DENY` is configured
- [ ] `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` is enabled
- [ ] `Strict-Transport-Security` with `includeSubDomains`
- [ ] `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- [ ] `Content-Security-Policy` is configured appropriately

### CORS Configuration
- [ ] Allowed origins are specifically defined (no wildcards)
- [ ] Only necessary HTTP methods are allowed
- [ ] Headers are restricted to essential ones
- [ ] Credentials are handled securely
- [ ] Preflight requests are properly configured

## Error Handling & Logging

### Error Responses
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- [ ] Stack traces are not exposed to users
- [ ] Database errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Generic error messages are used for security failures
- [ ] HTTP status codes are appropriate and consistent

### Security Logging
- [ ] Authentication attempts are logged
- [ ] Failed login attempts are recorded with IP and timestamp
- [ ] Rate limit violations are logged
- [ ] Security policy violations are monitored
- [ ] Log levels are configured appropriately

### Monitoring & Alerting
- [ ] Security events trigger appropriate alerts
- [ ] Log aggregation is configured for analysis
- [ ] Anomaly detection is in place
- [ ] Incident response procedures are documented

## Configuration Security

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables
- [ ] Default passwords and keys are changed
- [ ] Debug mode is disabled in production
- [ ] Database credentials are secure and rotated
- [ ] API keys and secrets are properly managed

### Deployment Security
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced for all communications
- [ ] TLS version is 1.3 or higher
- [ ] Certificate validation is properly configured
- [ ] Security patches are regularly applied
- [ ] Dependencies are kept up to date

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Security Testing
- [ ] Authentication flows are thoroughly tested
- [ ] Rate limiting is validated under load
- [ ] Input validation tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests include security scenarios
- [ ] Error handling is tested comprehensively

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Rate limiting enforcement and reset behavior
- [ ] JWT token generation, validation, and expiration
- [ ] Password complexity and hashing verification
- [ ] Input sanitization and injection prevention
- [ ] Security header presence and configuration

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Authentication performance under load is verified
- [ ] Rate limiting doesn't severely impact normal operation
- [ ] Concurrent user handling is tested
- [ ] Resource usage is monitored and optimized

## Code Quality & Security

### Secure Coding Practices
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
