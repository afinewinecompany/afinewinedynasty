# Project Brief: A Fine Wine Dynasty

*Generated: 2025-09-24*

---

## Executive Summary

**A Fine Wine Dynasty** is a machine learning-powered prospect evaluation platform that helps dynasty fantasy baseball players make data-driven decisions about minor league prospects. The app solves the critical problem of prospect evaluation uncertainty by analyzing historical performance patterns of minor leaguers who advanced to the majors, combining statistical data with scouting grades to generate predictive rankings.

The primary target market is serious dynasty fantasy baseball players who need reliable, up-to-date prospect evaluations to maintain competitive advantages in long-term league formats. The key value proposition is transforming scattered, hard-to-interpret prospect data into actionable rankings that directly inform roster decisions, trading strategies, and draft selections.

---

## Problem Statement

Dynasty fantasy baseball players face a critical information asymmetry problem when evaluating minor league prospects. Current prospect evaluation requires manually synthesizing data from multiple sources (Fangraphs, MLB Pipeline, Statcast), interpreting inconsistent scouting grades, and attempting to predict major league success without historical context or predictive modeling.

**Current State & Pain Points:**
- **Data fragmentation:** Critical prospect information scattered across 4+ different platforms with varying formats and update frequencies
- **Analysis paralysis:** Raw statistics and scouting grades provide overwhelming detail without clear actionable insights
- **Inconsistent evaluation criteria:** Different sources use different grading scales and methodologies, making comparisons difficult
- **Time-intensive research:** Competitive dynasty players spend hours weekly researching prospects manually
- **Lack of predictive context:** No easy way to understand how similar historical prospects performed in majors

**Impact & Quantification:**
The stakes are high in dynasty leagues where prospect evaluation directly impacts long-term competitiveness. Poor prospect decisions compound over seasons, with missed opportunities on breakout players or overinvestment in busts creating multi-year competitive disadvantages.

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Generic fantasy sites focus on redraft formats, not dynasty-specific prospect evaluation
- Statistical sites provide raw data without predictive modeling or historical context
- Scouting reports are subjective and inconsistent across evaluators
- No tool currently combines statistical analysis with ML-powered historical pattern recognition

**Urgency:** The dynasty fantasy baseball market is growing, and early-adopter advantages in prospect evaluation create sustainable competitive moats for both players and platform providers.

## Proposed Solution

**A Fine Wine Dynasty** creates a unified prospect evaluation engine that combines machine learning with comprehensive data integration to deliver actionable prospect rankings. The core solution architecture includes:

**Core Concept & Approach:**
- **Historical Pattern Analysis:** ML models trained on 15+ years of minor league → major league transition data to identify predictive performance indicators
- **Multi-Source Data Integration:** Automated aggregation from Fangraphs, MLB Statcast, MLB APIs, and scouting databases into unified prospect profiles
- **Dynamic Ranking System:** Real-time prospect rankings that update as new performance data and scouting reports become available
- **Context-Rich Analytics:** Each prospect rating includes historical comparisons, confidence intervals, and breakout probability assessments

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Predictive vs. Descriptive:** Unlike existing tools that show "what happened," AFWD predicts "what will happen" based on historical patterns
2. **Dynasty-Specific Focus:** Rankings optimized for long-term value rather than immediate fantasy impact
3. **Confidence Scoring:** Each rating includes uncertainty measures, helping users understand risk levels
4. **Automated Data Pipeline:** Eliminates manual research through intelligent data aggregation and processing

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
- **Data Advantage:** Comprehensive historical dataset creates training advantages that improve over time
- **User Experience:** Transforms hours of manual research into minutes of decision-making
- **Network Effects:** More users → more validation data → better predictions → more users
- **Barrier to Entry:** Complex ML infrastructure and data licensing create competitive moats

**High-Level Product Vision:**
A mobile-first web application where dynasty fantasy players can quickly access up-to-date prospect rankings, compare players side-by-side, track prospects over time, and receive alerts when rankings change significantly. The platform evolves from basic rankings to include trade analyzers, roster optimizers, and league-specific customizations.
