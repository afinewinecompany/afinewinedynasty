# Final notes
notes: |
  UPDATED ASSESSMENT: Story 3.4 now meets all quality standards.

  Documentation remediation completed on 2025-09-30:
  - All React components enhanced with comprehensive JSDoc
  - All Python services enhanced with detailed docstrings
  - Performance annotations added throughout

  This is a high-quality implementation with:
  - Excellent architecture and clean separation of concerns
  - Comprehensive testing at all levels
  - Sophisticated discovery algorithms
  - Proper security controls
  - Performance optimization
  - Complete documentation compliance

  The implementation is production-ready with no blocking issues.
  Minor performance optimizations may be considered at scale but are non-critical.

  Story recommended for DONE status.
