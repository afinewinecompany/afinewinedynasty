# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "All endpoints properly authenticated with JWT. Input validation via Pydantic schemas. User-scoped queries prevent data leakage. No hardcoded secrets."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient database queries with proper indexing. Async patterns throughout. Expected response times <100ms. No N+1 query patterns."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with rollback on failures. Proper logging. Clear error messages. Database constraints prevent invalid states."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation (JSDoc/docstrings). Clean separation of concerns. TypeScript strict mode. Follows established patterns."
  testability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Onboarding service has excellent unit tests (12 test cases). Watchlist service missing tests entirely. No integration or E2E tests. Services easily testable with good separation."
