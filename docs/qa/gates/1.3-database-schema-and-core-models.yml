  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "SQLAlchemy ORM protects against injection. Comprehensive constraints prevent invalid data."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Architecture supports <100ms targets with proper indexing and TimescaleDB. Validation testing incomplete."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Foreign key constraints with cascade rules ensure data integrity. Migration rollback supported."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Modern SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with typed annotations. Clean separation of concerns."

risk_assessment:
  overall_risk: "Low-Medium"
  rationale: "Schema is production-ready. Risks are in validation gaps, not implementation."
  mitigation: "Address performance testing in dedicated optimization story"
