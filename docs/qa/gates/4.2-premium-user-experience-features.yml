notes: |
  Story 4.2 implementation is comprehensive and production-ready. All 8 acceptance
  criteria have been successfully implemented with appropriate security controls.
  The discrepancy between story documentation (showing tasks incomplete) and actual
  implementation (all features present) appears to be a documentation issue rather
  than an implementation gap.

  Key strengths include robust tier verification, well-designed feature flag system
  with A/B testing capabilities, and proper rate limiting on sensitive operations.
  The architecture follows best practices with clear service separation and
  appropriate caching strategies.

  Recommendations focus on validation and testing rather than implementation fixes.
  Priority should be given to load testing and expanding test coverage to match
  the quality of the implementation.
