# Quality Gate Issues
top_issues:
  - id: "LINT-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "TypeScript linting errors: 6 explicit 'any' types, unused variables, unescaped entities"
    suggested_action: "Replace 'any' types with proper interfaces, remove unused imports/variables, escape apostrophes in JSX"
    suggested_owner: dev
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Export functionality could benefit from enhanced input sanitization"
    suggested_action: "Add comprehensive input validation for export parameters in production"
    suggested_owner: dev

# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "JWT auth, rate limiting, input validation implemented. Minor enhancement needed for export sanitization."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Meets performance requirements: <2s comparison load, proper caching strategy, optimized DB queries."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling, graceful degradation, robust comparison service."
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "TypeScript linting issues reduce code maintainability. Strong architecture otherwise."
