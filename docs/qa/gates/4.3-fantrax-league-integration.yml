# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✓ Fernet encryption for refresh tokens (security.py:110-141)
      ✓ OAuth state CSRF protection validated in tests
      ✓ Premium tier authorization checks on all endpoints
      ✓ decrypt_value() now raises ValueError on failure instead of silent fail
      ✓ JWT validation on all protected endpoints
      ✓ Foreign key relationships prevent unauthorized access

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✓ Redis caching with appropriate TTLs (24hr leagues, 1hr rosters, 30min recommendations)
      ✓ GIN index added for JSONB position array queries (migration line 73)
      ✓ Async/await patterns prevent blocking throughout
      ✓ Rate limiting with retry logic for Fantrax API
      ✓ Database indexes on common query patterns (league_id, user_id)
      Targets: roster sync <5s, recommendations <2s, OAuth <3s

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✓ Database transaction management with commit/rollback in _store_roster_in_db()
      ✓ FantraxSyncHistory tracks both success and failure
      ✓ Retry logic for rate-limited requests
      ✓ Proper error recovery and exception handling
      ✓ Foreign key cascades prevent orphaned records

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✓ Excellent code organization with clear service boundaries
      ✓ Comprehensive docstrings (@param, @returns, @since)
      ✓ Strong type safety (Pydantic + TypeScript)
      ✓ No code duplication, DRY principles
      ✓ Comprehensive test coverage (125+ tests) serves as documentation
