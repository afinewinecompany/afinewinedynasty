# NFR Assessment: 1.1

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - Rate limiting not yet implemented in development setup
- Performance: PASS - Architecture supports <2s page loads, <500ms ML predictions, <1s search targets
- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive error handling, health checks, and monitoring configured
- Maintainability: PASS - Full test coverage implemented with proper CI/CD pipeline

## Critical Issues

1. **Rate limiting not implemented** (Security)
   - Risk: Auth endpoints vulnerable to brute force attacks
   - Fix: Add rate limiting middleware to FastAPI auth endpoints
   - Story mentions rate limiting in requirements but implementation not evident in setup

## Quick Wins

- Add rate limiting middleware: ~2 hours
- Performance monitoring setup: ~1 hour (health checks exist, add metrics)
- Security headers configuration: ~30 minutes

## Detailed Assessment

### Security: CONCERNS
**Strengths:**
- JWT authentication architecture planned
- TLS 1.3 and AES-256 encryption specified
- Environment secrets management with .env templates
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline

**Gaps:**
- Rate limiting mentioned in requirements but not implemented in development setup
- Auth endpoints created but rate limiting middleware not yet configured

### Performance: PASS
**Strengths:**
- Next.js 14 with SSR for optimal page loads
- Redis caching infrastructure implemented
- Database optimized with PostgreSQL 15+ and TimescaleDB
- Multi-stage Docker builds for production efficiency
- Performance targets clearly defined (<2s page loads, <500ms ML, <1s search)

### Reliability: PASS
**Strengths:**
- Health check endpoints implemented
- Comprehensive error handling structure in FastAPI
- Docker containerization with proper configuration
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing
- Database with proper connection pooling

### Maintainability: PASS
**Strengths:**
- Full test coverage for both frontend (Jest/React Testing Library) and backend (pytest)
- Comprehensive documentation and setup guides
- Proper monorepo structure with clear separation of concerns
- ESLint/Prettier for code quality
- Environment configuration management
